The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have
been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current
studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive
photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate
the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological

employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network
(ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-
chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs
and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of
$m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le

study the sensitivities of Lorentz-violating coefficients for three distinct
types of clock redshift tests, including the traditional gravitational redshift
test, null-redshift test I and null-redshift test II. Each of these tests is
sensitivity to different combinations of Lorentz-violating coefficients. By
using the current clock comparison results, we estimate the limits of SME
coefficients at level of parts in $10^{4}$ down to parts in $10^{7}$. Better
sensitivity may be achieved in the clock comparisons by using the state-of-the-
art optical clocks. Additionally considering relativistic factors in null-
redshift I, the frequency comparison result of E2 and E3 transitions of Yb$^{+}$
can set the limit $c^{e}_{00}=(7.4\pm9.3)\times10^{-9}$ in the electron sector.

that deviations from General Relativity cannot be excluded within given

tunnels along a large number of consecutive minima in its potential. In this
work we perform the first comprehensive calculation of the gravitational wave
spectrum of chain inflation. In contrast to slow-roll inflation the latter does
not stem from quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field during inflation,
but rather from the bubble collisions during the first-order phase transitions
associated with vacuum tunneling. Our calculation is performed within an
effective theory of chain inflation which builds on an expansion of the
tunneling rate capturing most of the available model space. The effective theory
can be seen as chain inflation's analogue of the slow-roll expansion in rolling
models of inflation. We show that chain inflation produces a very characteristic
double-peak spectrum: a faint high-frequency peak associated with the
gravitational radiation emitted during inflation, and a strong low-frequency
peak associated with the graceful exit from chain inflation (marking the
transition to the radiation-dominated epoch). There exist very exciting
prospects to test the gravitational wave signal from chain inflation at the
aLIGO-aVIRGO-KAGRA network, at LISA and /or at pulsar timing array experiments.
A particularly intriguing possibility we point out is that chain inflation could
be the source of the stochastic gravitational wave background recently detected
by NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA and CPTA. We also show that the gravitational wave
signal of chain inflation is often accompanied by running/ higher running of the
scalar spectral index to be tested at future Cosmic Microwave Background

of the observed pulsar timing correlations as caused by an ultra-light $L_{\mu}

correlations in two ways. The gravitational potential of vector ULDM gives rise
to a Shapiro time delay of the pulsar signals and a non-trivial angular
correlation (as compared to the scalar ULDM case). In addition, if the pulsars
have a non-zero charge of the dark matter gauge group, then the electric field
of the local dark matter causes an oscillation of the pulsar and a corresponding
Doppler shift of the pulsar signal. We point out that pulsars carry a
significant charge of muons, and thus the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ vector dark
matter contributes to both the Doppler oscillations and the time delay of the
pulsar signals. The synergy between these two effects provides a better fit to
the shape of the angular correlation function, as observed by the NANOGrav
collaboration, compared to the standard SGWB explanation or the SGWB combined
with time delay explanations. Our analysis shows that in addition to the SGWB

description of dark many flavor QCD and show that the model undergoes ultra-

along the (approximately realized) flat direction based on the Gildener-Weinberg

address the reheating and relaxation processes, which are generically non-
thermal and nonadiabatic. Parametrizing the reheating epoch in terms of the
e-folding number, we propose proper formulae for the redshift effects on the GW
frequencies and signal spectra. It then turns out that the ultra-supercooling
predicted from the Higgs-portal scalegenesis generically yields none of GW
signals with the frequencies as low as nano Hz, unless the released latent heat
is transported into another sector other than reheating the universe. Instead,
models of this class prefer to give the higher frequency signals and still keeps
the future prospected detection sensitivity, like at LISA, BBO, and DECIGO, etc.
We also find that with large flavors in the dark sector, the GW signals are made
further smaller and the peak frequencies higher. Characteristic phenomenological
consequences related to the multiple chiral scalars include the prediction of
dark pions with the mass much less than TeV scale, which is also briefly
addressed.},

model. Another possible explanation is baryogenesis through the hypermagnetic
fields which involves the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly and helical hypermagnetic

leptogenesis and baryogenesis through the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly, we investigate
the simplest model that combines these two scenarios and explore the parameter

specific region of parameter space that is not covered by either one separately.
In fact, the minimum required mass scale of the RHN and strength of initial
hypermagnetic helicity are reduced by one order of magnitude in our model.
Moreover, we find that in the combined scenario, leptogenesis and baryogenesis
through the ${\rm U}_Y(1)$ anomaly can either amplify or reduce the effect of
each other, i.e., the generated asymmetry, depending on the sign of the helical
hypermagnetic fields. Finally, we show the surprising result that a drastic

collected strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background in the
nHz-frequency band. In this work we perform a detailed statistical analysis of
the signal in order to elucidate its physical origin. Specifically, we test the
standard explanation in terms of supermassive black hole mergers against the
prominent alternative explanation in terms of a first-order phase transition. By
means of a frequentist hypothesis test we find that the observed gravitational
wave spectrum prefers a first-order phase transition at $2-3\sigma$ significance
compared to black hole mergers (depending on the underlying black hole model).
This mild preference is linked to the relatively large amplitude of the observed
gravitational wave signal (above the typical expectation of black hole models)
and to its spectral shape (which slightly favors the phase-transition spectrum
over the predominantly single power-law spectrum predicted in black hole
models). The best fit to the combined PTA data set is obtained for a phase
transition which dominantly produces the gravitational wave signal by bubble
collisions (rather than by sound waves). The best-fit (energy-density) spectrum
features, within the frequency band of the PTA experiments, a crossover from a
steeply rising power law (causality tail) to a softly rising power law; the peak
frequency then falls slightly above the PTA-measured range. Such a spectrum can
be obtained for a strong first-order phase transition in the thick-wall regime
of vacuum tunneling which reheats the Universe to a temperature of $T_*\sim
\text{GeV}$. A dark sector phase transition at the GeV-scale provides a
comparably good fit.},

  abstract = {There is solid theoretical and observational motivation behind the idea of
scale-invariance as a fundamental symmetry of Nature. We consider a recently
proposed classically scale-invariant inflationary model, quadratic in curvature
and featuring a scalar field non-minimally coupled to gravity. We go beyond
earlier analytical studies, which showed that the model predicts inflationary
observables in qualitative agreement with data, by solving the full two-field
dynamics of the system -- this allows us to corroborate previous analytical
findings and set robust constraints on the model's parameters using the latest
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck and BICEP/Keck. We
demonstrate that scale-invariance constrains the two-field trajectory such that
the effective dynamics are that of a single field, resulting in vanishing
entropy perturbations and protecting the model from destabilization effects. We
derive tight upper limits on the non-minimal coupling strength, excluding
conformal coupling at high significance. By explicitly sampling over them, we
demonstrate an overall insensitivity to initial conditions. We argue that the
model \textit{predicts} a minimal level of primordial tensor modes set by $r
\gtrsim 0.003$, well within the reach of next-generation CMB experiments. These
will therefore provide a litmus test of scale-invariant inflation, and we
comment on the possibility of distinguishing the model from Starobinsky and
$\alpha$-attractor inflation. Overall, we argue that scale-invariant inflation
is in excellent health, and possesses features which make it an interesting
benchmark for tests of inflation from future CMB data.},

the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it allows small deviations
from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse takes place. The
subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical deviations grow,
the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich pancake". After that, the
more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent relaxation begins where shells of
the cloud cross and the matter is redistributed within a factor of a few of the
free fall timescale, reaching a spherical virialized state. During the whole
process, strong gravitational waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the
collapse and the small time interval that the effect takes place. The emission
of gravitational waves during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be
easily estimated with an analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to
capture the behaviour of matter during this stage in order to estimate the

the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales

spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced,
secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection
of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing

formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the
amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data
can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a
specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine
the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of
reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination.
Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the
formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the

  abstract = {Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a
promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early
Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings
produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$,
exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale
cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency
$f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed
string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all
oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm
cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early
Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of
the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an
exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation
modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale
$v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the
sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.},

Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early

discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and
up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then
present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on
topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a
symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These
constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs
and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion
models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken
Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must
lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ
PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of
signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to
probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models
domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss

a common prediction in various models of the early Universe. Despite constraints
at different frequency ranges and claims of detection in the nHz range by Pulsar
Timing Arrays, the amplitude and spectral dependence of the SGWB in the mHz
range remain largely unknown. Plausible models of early Universe Physics predict
a wide range of SGWB amplitudes, from undetectable to exceeding the constraints
from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. This paper explores the potential impact of a
prominent primordial SGWB on LISA's main scientific targets. Our main analyses
focuses on Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs). By employing publicly available
MBHB population models and state-of-the-art LISA's forecasting pipeline, we
analyze the effects of the SGWB on MBHB detections. We find that the decrease in
the signal-to-noise ratio induced by a strong primordial GWB can significantly
reduce the number of detectable events, compromise the precision of constraints,
and even hinder sky localization for some events. We also examine the impact of
the SGWB on Stellar Origin Black Hole Binaries (SOBHBs) and Galactic Binaries
(GBs), which are fainter sources than MBHBs. Depending on the spectral
properties of the SGWB, we conclude that these sources could be either

cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system

separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box

with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at
the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width,

discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic

expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in
discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference
generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the
HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as
"ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders,
resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply
these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set.
In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$

regime}. Such a regime is, for example, applicable to compact binaries
coalescing, where characteristic velocities can reach fifty percent the speed of
light and gravitational fields are large and dynamical. This review begins with
the theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational-wave observables of
modified gravity theories. The review continues with a brief description of the
detectors, including both gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar-timing
arrays, leading to a discussion of the data analysis formalism that is
applicable for such tests. The review then discusses gravitational-wave tests
using compact binary systems, and ends with a description of the first
gravitational wave observations by advanced LIGO, the stochastic gravitational
wave background observations by pulsar timing arrays, and the tests that can be

  abstract = {The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic
gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-
independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal
consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and
a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond
this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency
dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref).
We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and
perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL)
model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta
consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes
factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the
minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal;
however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta.
Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated
during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper
limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-
Virgo-KAGRA.},

smaller frequencies as the equation of state becomes softer. The power-law

first-order phase transition (PT) using the recently introduced Higgsless
approach to numerically simulate the fluid motion induced by the PT. We present
for the first time GW spectra sourced by bulk fluid motion in the aftermath of
strong first-order PTs ($\alpha = 0.5$), alongside weak ($\alpha = 0.0046$) and
intermediate ($\alpha = 0.05$) PTs, previously considered in the literature. We
find that, for intermediate and strong PTs, the kinetic energy in our

determined by non-linear dynamics and hence related to the production of
vorticity. We show that the assumption that the source is stationary in time,
characteristic of compressional motion in the linear regime (sound waves),
agrees with our numerical results for weak PTs, since in this case the kinetic
energy does not decay with time. We then provide a theoretical framework that
extends the stationary assumption to one that accounts for the time evolution of
the source: as a result, the GW energy density is no longer linearly increasing
with the source duration, but proportional to the integral over time of the
squared kinetic energy fraction. This effectively reduces the linear growth rate
of the GW energy density and allows to account for the period of transition from
the linear to the non-linear regimes of the fluid perturbations. We validate the
novel theoretical model with the results of simulations and provide templates

radiation-era contribution and opening a new window of detectable parameter

birefringence when GWs propagate over the symmetron backgrounds. Due to the
matter density difference, the symmetron profile changes significantly when
entering the galaxy, so that we need to discuss the extra-galactic and galactic
situations separately. On the one hand, the cosmological symmetron field follows
the adiabatic solution, which induces a parity-violating GW amplitude correction
with its exponent proportional to the GW frequency and the traveling distance.
On the other hand, the symmetron takes the screening solution within the Milky
Way, and the generated GW birefringence is only a function of the GW frequency.
By further comparing these two contributions, we find that the extra-galactic
symmetron field produces the dominant birefringence effects. Finally, with the

(SGWB). We investigate whether the NANOGrav signal is consistent with the SGWB
predicted by string cosmology models. By performing Bayesian parameter
estimation on the NANOGrav 15-year data set, we constrain the key parameters of
a string cosmology model: the frequency $f_s$ and the fractional energy density
$\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s}$ of gravitational waves at the end of the dilaton-driven
stage, and the Hubble parameter $H_r$ at the end of the string phase. Our
analysis yields constraints of $f_s = 1.2^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\times 10^{-8}
\mathrm{Hz}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{gw}^{s} = 2.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-8}$,
consistent with theoretical predictions from string cosmology. However, the
current NANOGrav data is not sensitive to the $H_r$ parameter. We also compare
the string cosmology model to a simple power-law model using Bayesian model
selection, finding a Bayes factor of $2.2$ in favor of the string cosmology
model. Our results demonstrate the potential of pulsar timing arrays to
constrain cosmological models and study the early Universe.},

finite time, by an exotic component which develops an anisotropic stress. We
find the best fitting parameters in these three cases to CMB and BAO data. We
compare the resulting $B$-mode spectra of the CMB to data from BICEP/Keck and

numerous scientific works have been published analyzing and further developing

contribute to the recent advancements in the field of PTAs by presenting the

be found using Gibbs sampling. Even though perfecting the implementation of the
Gibbs sampling and mitigating the numerical stability challenges require further

including the spatial curvature since the ISW effect is more sensitive to the
spatial curvature than the SW effect. Furthermore, we provide the cross-

between their SW effect terms depending on the GW mechanisms, which may hint at
the sign of $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ when considering non-Gaussianity contributions to
anisotropies.},

cross-correlating large-scale structure (LSS) tracers with the GWB spatial
anisotropies can extract a clear astrophysical imprint from the GWB signal.
Focusing on the unresolved population of supermassive black hole binaries
(SMBHBs) as the primary source for the GWB at nanohertz frequencies, we
construct full-sky maps of galaxy distributions and characteristic strain of the
GWB to explore the relationship between GWB anisotropies and the LSS. We find
that at current pulsar timing array (PTA) sensitivities, very few loud SMBHBs
act as Poisson-like noise. This results in anisotropies dominated by a small
number of sources, making GWB maps where SMBHBs trace the LSS indistinguishable
from a GWBs from a uniform distribution of SMBHBs. In contrast, we find that the
bulk of the unresolved SMBHBs produce anisotropies which mirror the spatial
distribution of galaxies, and thus trace the LSS. Importantly, we show that
cross-correlations are required to retrieve a clear LSS imprint in the GWB.
Specifically, we find this LSS signature can me measured at a $3\sigma$ level in
near-future PTA experiments that probe angular scales of $\ell_{\text{max}} \geq

spatial inhomogeneities in the axion field. GWs serve as key probe for
constraining the coupling strength between the axion and gauge fields. We find
that, when backreaction is important during inflation, the constraints on the
coupling strength due to GW overproduction are relaxed compared to previous
studies, in which backreaction matters only after inflation. Moreover, our
results suggest that the probability density function (PDF) of axion
fluctuations tends toward a Gaussian distribution even in cases where gauge
field backreaction is important only after inflation. This aligns with previous
studies where the same effect was observed for cases with strong backreaction
during inflation. This finding can be crucial for future studies of primordial

time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be
significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history
depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the
terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from
bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via
anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically

information about their internal structure and equation of state, and it can
provide tests of General Relativity. We present a search for CWs from a set of
45 known pulsars in the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing

independent analysis methods considering the single-harmonic and the dual-
harmonic emission models. We find no evidence of a CW signal in O4a data for
both models and set upper limits on the signal amplitude and on the ellipticity,
which quantifies the asymmetry in the neutron star mass distribution. For the
single-harmonic emission model, 29 targets have the upper limit on the amplitude
below the theoretical spin-down limit. The lowest upper limit on the amplitude
is $6.4\!\times\!10^{-27}$ for the young energetic pulsar J0537-6910, while the
lowest constraint on the ellipticity is $8.8\!\times\!10^{-9}$ for the bright
nearby millisecond pulsar J0437-4715. Additionally, for a subset of 16 targets
we performed a narrowband search that is more robust regarding the emission
model, with no evidence of a signal. We also found no evidence of non-standard
polarizations as predicted by the Brans-Dicke theory.},

also find that for Horndeski theories, such as Galileon theory, the relic
background produced by the thermalized scalar field can reach significant
amplitudes, exceeding the BBN bound for a region of the parameter space. By
requiring the relic graviton background to remain consistent with the BBN

Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of

perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive
the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their
anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies
through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations,
making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity.
Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with
the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them
from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations
enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background

tension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network safely
forms. In this study, we clarify the spectrum of stochastic GWB from metastable

gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which
gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling
order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For
models with $t>0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement
such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton
and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We
demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the
coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of
hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs.
Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all
theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during
kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains
flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available
parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the
Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at
the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the
spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The
observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and
$\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained
during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from
hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range.},

maps; a map-based parametric maximum-likelihood method; and a harmonic-space
internal linear combination using frequency maps. We summarize the conceptual

probe the impact of foreground residuals, we implement an iterative internal
delensing step, leveraging a map-based pipeline to generate a lensing $B$-mode

the performance of the three approaches is comparable for simple and
intermediate-complexity foregrounds, with $\sigma(r)$ ranging from 3 to 5
$\times 10^{-4}$. However, biases at the $1-2\sigma$ level appear when analyzing
more complex forms of foreground emission. By extending the baseline pipelines
to marginalize over foreground residuals, we demonstrate that contamination can
be reduced to within statistical uncertainties, albeit with a pipeline-dependent
impact on $\sigma(r)$, which translates to a detection significance between 2

gravitational wave (CGW) signals from individual massive black hole binaries

investigate the feasibility of conducting multimessenger studies by combining
the CGW detections from an idealized 30-year SKA PTA and the optical data from
the forthcoming LSST survey. To this end, we employed the $\texttt{L-Galaxies}$
semi-analytical model applied to the $\texttt{Millennium}$ simulation. We
generated 200 different all-sky lightcones that include galaxies, massive black
holes, and MBHBs whose emission is modeled based on their star formation
histories and gas accretion physics. We predict an average of $\approx 33$ CGW
detections, with signal-to-noise ratios $ S/N > 5$. The detected MBHBs are
typically at $z < 0.5$, with masses of $ \sim 3 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$, mass
ratios $> 0.6$ and eccentricities $\lesssim 0.2$. In terms of EM counterparts,
we find less than 15% of these systems to be connected with an AGN detectable by
LSST, while their host galaxies are easily detectable ($ < 23$ mag) massive ($
M_{\star} > 10^{11} M_{\odot}$) ellipticals with typical star formation rates
($10^{-15} yr^{-1} < sSRF < 10^{-10} yr^{-1}$). Although the CGW-EM counterpart
association is complicated by poor sky localization (only 35% of these CGWs are
localized within $\rm 100\, deg^2$), the number of galaxy host candidates can be
considerably reduced (thousands to tens) by applying priors based on the galaxy-
MBH correlations. However, picking the actual host among these candidates is
highly non-trivial, as they occupy a similar region in any optical color-color

the low-frequency multimessenger GW sky.},

has motivated experiments and observations that, so far, have been consistent
with the zero mass graviton of general relativity, but further tests will be
valuable. A basis for new tests may be the high sensitivity gravitational wave
experiments that are now being performed, and the higher sensitivity experiments
that are being planned. In these experiments it should be feasible to detect low
levels of dispersion due to nonzero graviton mass. One of the most promising
techniques for such a detection may be the pulsar timing program that is
sensitive to nano-Hertz gravitational waves.   Here we present some details of
such a detection scheme. The pulsar timing response to a gravitational wave
background with the massive graviton is calculated, and the algorithm to detect
the massive graviton is presented. We conclude that, with 90% probability,

biweekly observation of 60 pulsars are performed for 5 years with pulsar RMS

achievable in practice should be one order of magnitude better than this figure

gravitational effects on cosmological scales), because our calculations ignore

testing theories of gravity. Recent work has reinvigorated the study of bimetric
theories of gravity and massive gravity theories. One of the most interesting
predictions of these theories, as well as some string theories, is the
subluminal speed of propagating gravitational waves. Multi-messenger astronomy
provides a unique opportunity to put limits on the difference (either positive
or negative) between the propagation speed of electromagnetic and gravitational
waves from these sources. This paper considers limits from multi-messenger cases
across the planned measurable spectrum: first, the limits from isolated pulsars
based on the current best limits from LIGO on gravitational wave emission,
second, the limits from ultra-compact binaries that will be visible to a low-
frequency space-based gravitational wave observatory like LISA, and third,
limits from super massive black hole binaries using pulsar timing arrays. The
required phase comparison between the electromagnetic signal and the
gravitational wave signal is derived and, assuming a null result in that
comparison, the current bounds on emission are used to place limits on
alternative theories that exhibit propagation delays. Observations of the
pulsars in the most sensitive range of LIGO could put an upper limit on the
graviton mass as low as $10^{-38}\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and an upper limit on the
fractional difference between the gravitational wave and electromagnetic wave
speeds as low as $10^{-9}$. This paper shows results from the initial LIGO limit

potentially be probed by measuring the stochastic gravitational- wave
background. However, most existing treatments of this background beyond GR
overlook modifications to the energy carried by gravitational waves, or rely on
GR assumptions that are invalid in other theories. This may lead to
mistranslation between the observable cross-correlation of detector outputs and
gravitational-wave energy density, and thus to errors when deriving
observational constraints on theories. In this article, we lay out a generic

family of theories beyond GR. We explicitly state the (often tacit) assumptions
that go into these searches, evaluating their generic applicability, or lack
thereof. Examples of problematic assumptions are: statistical independence of
linear polarization amplitudes; which polarizations satisfy equipartition; and
which polarizations have well-defined phase velocities. We also show how to
correctly infer the value of the stochastic energy density in the context of any

  abstract = {Gravitational waves can probe fundamental physics, leading to new constraints on
the mass of the graviton. Previous tests, however, have neglected the effect of
screening, which is typically present in modified theories that predict a non-
zero graviton mass. We here study whether future gravitational wave observations
can constrain the graviton mass when screening effects are taken into account.
We first consider model-independent corrections to the propagation of
gravitational waves due to screened massive graviton effects. We find that
future observation can place constraints on the screening radius and the
graviton mass of ${\cal{O}}(10^{2})$--${\cal{O}}(10^{4})$ Mpc and
${\cal{O}}(10^{-22})$--${\cal{O}}(10^{-26})$ eV respectively. We also consider
screening effects in two specific theories, ghost-free massive gravity and
bigravity, that might not realize these types of propagation modifications, but
that do provide analytic expressions for screening parameters relevant to our
analysis allowing for more concrete results. However, the constraints we are
able to place are small. The reason for this is that second- and third-
generation detectors are sensitive to graviton masses that lead to very small
screening radii in these particular models. The effect of screening, however,
can become important as constraints on the graviton mass are improved through
the stacking of multiple observations in the near future.},

opened a new window with which to measure cosmological parameters such as the
Hubble constant $H_0$, and also probe general relativity on large scales. In
this paper we present a new phenomenological approach, together with its
inferencial implementation, for measuring deviations from general relativity
(GR) on cosmological scales concurrently with a determination of $H_0$. We
consider gravitational waves (GWs) propagating in an expanding homogeneous and
isotropic background, but with a modified friction term and dispersion relation
relative to that of GR. We find that a single binary neutron star GW detection
will poorly constrain the GW friction term. However, a joint analysis including
the GW phase and GW-GRB detection delay could improve constraints on some GW
dispersion relations provided the delay is measured with millisecond precision.
We also show that, for massive gravity, by combining 100 binary neutron stars
detections with observed electromagnetic counterparts and hosting galaxy
identification, we will be able to constrain the Hubble constant, the GW damping
term and the GW dispersion relation with 2\%, 15\% and 2 \% accuracy,
respectively. We emphasise that these three parameters should be measured
together in order avoid biases. Finally we apply the method to GW170817, and
demonstrate that for all the GW dispersions relations we consider, including
massive gravity, the GW must be emitted $\sim$ 1.74s before the Gamma-ray burst
(GRB). Furthermore, at the GW merger peak frequency, we show that the fractional
difference between the GW group velocity and $c$ is $\lesssim 10^{-17}$.},

effectively sink close to the galaxy center, provided that the black hole's

the simulation. Gas drag also plays a role in assisting the black holes' orbital
decay, but it is typically less effective than that from collisionless
particles, especially after the first billion years of the black hole's
evolution. DF from gas becomes less than $1\%$ of DF from collisionless
particles for BH masses $> 10^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Using our best DF model, we
calculate the merger rate down to $z=1.1$ using an $L_{\rm box}=35$ Mpc$/h$

$z\sim 2$. These merger rates are within the range obtained in previous work

equivalence principle (WEP) violation may lead to frequency-dependent variations
in the propagation speed of GWs, which can be examined by comparing the
theoretical and observed discrepancies in the arrival times of GW signals at
various frequencies. This provides us with an opportunity to test these
theories. For massive gravity, we consider that gravitons may have a nonzero
rest mass. For WEP violations, we hypothesize that different massless particles
exposed to the same gravitational source should exhibit varying gravitational
time delays. The gravitational time delay induced by massive gravitational
sources is proportional to $\gamma+1$, where the parameter $\gamma=1$ in GR.
Therefore, we can quantify these two deviations using phenomenological
parameters $m_g$ and $|\Delta \gamma|$, respectively. In this study, we use
selected GW data from binary black hole coalescences in the LIGO-Virgo catalogs
GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 to place constraints on the parameters $m_g$ and $|\Delta

well as between $|\Delta \gamma|$ and both luminosity distance sky location of
GW events to determine the presence of graviton mass and WEP violation.
Nevertheless, we find no evidence of such relationships. We also compute Bayes
factors for models that assume the existence of graviton mass and WEP violation
compared to the standard GW model, respectively. The absolute value of the
natural logarithm of the Bayes factor is generally less than 2. Our analysis
reveals no significant preference for either model. Additionally, the Bayes

gravitational wave astronomy capable of probing into the strong field dynamics
of black holes and neutron stars. It has opened up an exciting new window for
laboratory and space tests of Einstein's theory of classical general relativity.
In recent years there are two interesting proposals aimed at revealing the
quantum natures of perturbative gravity: 1) theoretical predictions in how
graviton noise from the early universe after the vacuum of the gravitational
field was strongly squeezed by inflationary expansion; 2) experimental proposals
using the quantum entanglement between two masses each in a superposition state.
The first proposal invokes the stochastic properties of quantum fields, the
second invokes a key concept of quantum information. An equally basic and
interesting idea is to ask whether and how gravity might be responsible for a
quantum system becoming classical in appearance, known as gravitational
decoherence. Decoherence due to gravity is of special interest because gravity
is universal. This is an important issue in macroscopic quantum phenomena. To
fully appreciate these exciting developments requires a working knowledge in
classical GR, QF theory and QI plus some familiarity with stochastic processes,
namely, noise in quantum fields. Traditionally a new researcher may be
conversant in one or two of these four subjects: GR, QFT, QI, SP, depending on
his/her background. This tutorial attempts to provide the necessary connections

subgrid physics model that has been recalibrated to reproduce various observed
stellar and gas properties. We focus on the two-point correlation functions of
the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and emission line galaxies (ELGs), which are
primary targets of ongoing and future galaxy surveys such as DESI. One
surprising result is that, due to several nontrivial effects of modified gravity
on matter clustering and the galaxy-halo connection, the clustering signal does
not depend monotonically on the fifth-force strength. For LRGs this complicated
behaviour poses a challenge to meaningfully constraining this model. For ELGs,
in contrast, this can be straightforwardly explained by the time evolution of
the fifth force, which means that weaker $f(R)$ models can display nearly the
same -- up to $25\%$ -- deviations from $\Lambda$CDM as the strongest ones,
albeit at lower redshifts. This implies that even very weak $f(R)$ models can be
strongly constrained, unlike with most other observations. Our results show that
galaxy formation acquires a significant environment dependence in $f(R)$ gravity
which, if not properly accounted for, may lead to biased constraints on the
model. This highlights the essential role of hydrodynamical simulations in
future tests of gravity exploring precision galaxy-clustering data from the

infer the Hubble constant at the $10\%$~level of precision with future-
generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and only 100 observations

improve the bounds on $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and $w$ by a factor of two. This
improvement is driven by background information contained in the BAO, which
breaks the degeneracy with $H_0$ in the CMB. We confirm this by comparing the
BOSS full-shape information with BOSS BAO, finding no significant differences.

< 5 \times 10^{-12}$ eV. While this stronger bound depends on the ICM modeling,
it is independent of the strength of the IGM magnetic field, for which there is
no direct evidence yet. These constraints could be placed on firmer footing with
an enhanced understanding and control of the astrophysical uncertainties
associated with the IGM and ICM. All the bounds are determined by the shape of
the Hubble rate as a function of redshift reconstructable from various distance
measurements, and insensitive to today's Hubble rate, of which there is a
tension between early and late cosmological measurements. As an appendix, we
discuss the model building challenges of the use of photon-axion conversion to
make type Ia supernovae brighter to alleviate the Hubble problem/crisis.},

on DFSZ QCD axion models. Such constructions are especially interesting in light

for $m_a\gtrsim 0.1$ eV, scatterings of pions and muons can produce a sizable
cosmic background of thermal axions, that behave similarly to massive neutrinos.
However, the pion coupling depends on the alignment between the vevs of two
Higgs doublets, and can be significantly suppressed or enhanced with respect to
the KSVZ scenario. Using the latest Planck and BAO data, we find $m_a\leq
0.2~\text{eV}$ at $95\%$ C.L., when the axion coupling to pions $c_{a\pi}$ is
maximal. Constraints on $m_a$, instead, can be significantly relaxed when
$c_{a\pi}$ is small. In particular, we point out that in the so-called DFSZ-II
model, where the axion coupling to leptons does not vanish simultaneously with
$c_{a\pi}$, production via muons gives $m_a\leq 0.6~\text{eV}$ at $95\%$ C.L.,
whereas in the DFSZ-I model bounds on $m_a$ can be fully lifted. We then combine
cosmological data with recent hints of a DFSZ axion coupled to electrons from

to be in the window $0.07 ~\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 1.8\,

cooling hints gives $3 ~\text{meV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 0.2 ~\text{eV}$ for
DFSZ-II, while no constraint arises in the DFSZ-I case. Forthcoming CMB Stage 4
experiments will be able to further test such scenarios; for instance the

Universe, which provides an effective description of the evolution of
4-dimensional string-inspired cosmologies from inflation till the present epoch.
In the context of this "stringy RVM" version, it is assumed that the early
Universe is characterised by purely gravitational degrees of freedom, from the
massless gravitational string multiplet, including the antisymmetric tensor
field. The latter plays an important role, since its dual gives rise to a
`stiff' gravitational-axion "matter", which in turn couples to the gravitational
anomaly terms, assumed to be non-trivial at early epochs. In the presence of
primordial gravitational wave (GW) perturbations, such anomalous couplings lead
to an RVM-like dynamical inflation, without external inflatons. We review here
this framework and discuss potential scenarios for the generation of such
primordial GW, among which the formation of unstable domain walls, which
eventually collapse in a non-spherical-symmetric manner, giving rise to GW. We
also remark that the same type of "stiff" axionic matter could provide, upon the
generation of appropriate potentials during the post-inflationary eras, (part
of) the Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe, which could well be ultralight,
depending on the parameters of the string-inspired model. All in all, the new
(stringy) mechanism for RVM-inflation preserves the basic structure of the
original (and more phenomenological) RVM, as well as its main advantages:
namely, a mechanism for graceful exit and for generating a huge amount of
entropy capable of explaining the horizon problem. It also predicts axionic DM
and the existence of mild dynamical Dark Energy (DE) of quintessence type in the
present universe, both being "living fossils" of the inflationary stages of the
cosmic evolution.},

searches underway at the interface between cosmology, particle physics, and
field theory. The mystery of dark matter (DM) is one of the greatest common
unsolved problems between these fields. It is established now based on many
astrophysical and cosmological observations that only a small fraction of the
total matter content of the universe is made of baryonic matter, while the vast
majority is constituted by dark matter. However, the nature of such a component
is still unknown. One theoretically well-motivated approach to understanding the
nature of dark matter would be through looking for light pseudo-scalar
candidates for dark matter such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs).
Axions are hypothetical elementary particles resulting from the Peccei-Quinn
(PQ) solution to the strong CP (charge-parity) problem in quantum chromodynamics
(QCD). Furthermore, many theoretically well-motivated extensions to the standard
model of particle physics (SMPP) predicted the existence of more pseudo-scalar
particles similar to the QCD axion and called ALPs. Axions and ALPs are
characterized by their coupling with two photons. While the coupling parameter
for axions is related to the axion mass, there is no direct relation between the
coupling parameter and the mass of ALPs. Nevertheless, it is expected that ALPs
share the same phenomenology of axions. In the past years, axions and ALPs
regained popularity and slowly became one of the most appealing candidates that
possibly contribute to the dark matter density of the universe. In this thesis,
we focus on studying the phenomenology of axions and ALPs interactions with

photons. In this work, we explore the axionic defects hypothesis in more detail
and extending previous results to annihilating and late-forming networks, and by
pointing out other smoking-gun signatures of the network in the CMB spectrum

the presence of cosmic strings in the network does not hinder a large isotropic
birefringence signal because of an intrinsic environmental contribution coming
from low redshifts thus leaving open the possibility that axionic defects can
explain the signal. Regarding the remaining CMB signatures, with the help of
dedicated 3D numerical simulations of DW networks, that we took as a proxy for
the axionic defects, we show how the anisotropic birefringence spectrum combined
with a tomographic approach can be used to infer the formation and annihilation
time of the network. From the numerical simulations, we also computed the
spectrum of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by the network in the post-
recombination epoch and use previous searches for stochastic GW backgrounds in
the CMB to derive for the first time a bound on the tension and abundance of
networks with DWs that annihilate after recombination. Our bounds extend to the

particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a
galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV
to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic
fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in
the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy
cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field
and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying
$\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different
from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of
cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around
a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion
in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure
the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using

photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they have the
same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant conversion
would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature fluctuations
with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant conversion depends on
the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field, electron density, and
its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can happen in numerous
unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will lead to a diffused
polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The spectrum of the signal and
its shape in the angular scale will be different from the lensed CMB
polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum will be correlated
with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence, with the large-
scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its spectral and spatial

As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a
pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to
small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized
pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can
be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with
electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the
ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To
accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that

astronomy. Besides the discovery and a deeper understanding of various
astrophysical sources, JWST can also uncover the non-gravitational nature of
dark matter (DM). If DM is QCD axion or an eV-scale Axion-like particle (ALP),
it can decay into two photons in the infrared band. This will produce a distinct
line signature in the spectroscopic observations made by JWST. Using the latest
NIRSpec IFU spectroscopic observations from JWST, we put the strongest bound on
the photon coupling for QCD axion/ ALP DM in the mass range between 0.47 and
2.55 eV. In particular, we are able to probe a new mass range for ALP DM between
$\sim$ 0.47 eV to 0.78 eV beyond what can be probed by globular cluster
observations. We constrain well-motivated and UV complete models of QCD axion
and ALP DM, including predictions from some models derived from string theory
and/ or various Grand Unification scenarios. Future JWST observations of DM-rich
systems with a better understanding of the astrophysical and instrumental
backgrounds can thus enable us to potentially discover QCD axion and ALP DM. The

natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter
consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark
energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter
mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a
phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a
slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth

In practice, we simultaneously derive the early and late parameters using baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, which provide both low and high-
redshift information. To resolve parameter degeneracy, the complementary data
from CMB observations are included in the analysis. By using the parameter
$\omega_m = \Omega_mh^2$, we introduce ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m)$, defined as the
ratio of $\omega_m$ which are constrained from high and low-redshift
measurements respectively, to quantify the consistency between early and late
parameters. We obtained a value of ${\rm ratio}(\omega_m) = 1.0069\pm0.0070$,
indicating there is no tension between early parameters and late parameters in
the framework of $\Lambda$CDM model. As a result, the Hubble tension may arise
from the differences of datasets or unknown systematic errors in the current

that the foreground from individually detectable merger events can be reduced

foreground from subthreshold binary neutron stars (BNSs) will be the bottleneck

approach from the individually detectable BNSs utilizing the isotropic orbital
orientations of all BNSs, i.e., uniform distribution in $\cos\iota$, where
$\iota$ is the BNS inclination angle with respect to the line of sight. Using
this approach, we find $\Omega_{\rm sub}$ can be measured with percent-level

assumptions about the spatial distribution of the signal or contaminants, and
only assume knowledge of the frequency dependence of the signal. The ILC is a
minimum-variance linear combination of the measured frequency maps. In the case
of Gaussian, statistically isotropic fields, this is the optimal linear
combination, as the variance is the only statistic of interest. However, in many
cases the signal we wish to isolate, or the foregrounds we wish to remove, are
non-Gaussian and/or statistically anisotropic (in particular for Galactic
foregrounds). In such cases, it is possible that machine learning (ML)
techniques can be used to exploit the non-Gaussian features of the foregrounds
and thereby improve component separation. However, many ML techniques require
the use of complex, difficult-to-interpret operations on the data. We propose a
hybrid method whereby we train an ML model using only combinations of the data
that $\textit{do not contain the signal}$, and combine the resulting ML-
predicted foreground estimate with the ILC solution to reduce the error from the
ILC. We demonstrate our methods on simulations of extragalactic temperature and
Galactic polarization foregrounds, and show that our ML model can exploit non-
Gaussian features, such as point sources and spatially-varying spectral indices,
to produce lower-variance maps than ILC - eg, reducing the variance of the
B-mode residual by factors of up to 5 - while preserving the signal of interest
in an unbiased manner. Moreover, we often find improved performance when
applying our model to foreground models on which it was not trained.},

evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the

suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both.
Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space
relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially
account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks
statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a
natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables
without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our
investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB
correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by
tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating
scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational
assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for
exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.},

CMB experiments, which will measure acoustic peaks to much smaller scales and
resolve polarization signals with higher signal-to-noise over large sky areas,

model-agnostic method to capture most relevant possible deviations from
$\Lambda$CDM due to additional non-interacting components, while remaining
sufficiently constraining to enable detection across various scenarios. The
phenomenological model uses a fluid model with four parameters governing
additional density contributions that peak at different redshifts, and two sound
speed parameters. We forecast possible constraints with Simons Observatory,
explore parameter degeneracies that arise in $\Lambda$CDM, and demonstrate that
this method could detect a range of specific models. Which of the new parameters
gets excited can indicate the nature of any new physics, while the generality of
the model allows for testing with future data in a way that should not be
plagued by a posteriori choices or publication bias.   When testing our model
with Planck data, we find good consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM model, but the

today's Hubble constant $H_0$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Motivated by these interesting
observations, we investigate and reveal the underlying mechanism for this
correlation, using the CMB dataset without the low-$\ell$ polarization data as a
proxy for a potential cosmology with a larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$. We further
explore how this correlation may impact the Hubble tension between early and
late universe measurements of $H_0$, in $\Lambda$CDM as well as two proposals to
alleviate the Hubble tension: the dark radiation (DR) and early dark energy
(EDE) models. We find that the Hubble tension gets further reduced mildly for
almost all cases due to the larger $\tau_{\rm reio}$ and its positive
correlation with $H_0$, with either the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data
before those from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) or the DESI

plane during propagation. Such an effect is a tracer of parity-violating
extensions of standard electromagnetism and would probe the existence of a new
cosmological field acting as dark matter or dark energy. It has become customary
to employ cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarised data to probe such a
phenomenon. Recent analyses on Planck and WMAP data provide a hint of detection
of the isotropic CB angle with an amplitude of around $0.3^\circ$ at the level
of $2.4$ to $3.6\sigma$. In this work, we explore the LiteBIRD capabilities in
constraining such an effect, accounting for the impact of the more relevant
systematic effects, namely foreground emission and instrumental polarisation
angles. We build five semi-independent pipelines and test these against four
different simulation sets with increasing complexity in terms of non-idealities.
All the pipelines are shown to be robust and capable of returning the expected
values of the CB angle within statistical fluctuations for all the cases
considered. We find that the uncertainties in the CB estimates increase with
more complex simulations. However, the trend is less pronounced for pipelines
that account for the instrumental polarisation angles. For the most complex case
analysed, we find that LiteBIRD will be able to detect a CB angle of $0.3^\circ$

the pipeline employed, where the latter uncertainty corresponds to a total error

their dispersion relations is a crucial task for scrutinizing the viability of
extended theories of gravity. A tool to investigate the polarization states of
GWs is the well-known formalism developed by Eardley, Lee, and Lightman (ELL)
[Phys. Rev. D 8, 3308 (1973)] which uses the Newman-Penrose (NP) coefficients to
determine the polarization content of GWs in metric theories of gravity.
However, if the speed of GWs is smaller than the speed of light, the number of
NP coefficients is greater than the number of polarizations. To overcome this
inconvenience we use the Bardeen formalism to describe the six possible
polarization modes of GWs considering general dispersion relations for the
modes. The definition of a new gauge-invariant quantity enables an unambiguous
description of the scalar longitudinal polarization mode. We apply the formalism
to General Relativity, scalar-tensor theories, $f(R)$-gravity, and a wide class
of quadratic gravity. We derive an explicit relation between a physical
observable (the derivative of the frequency shift of an electromagnetic signal),
and the gauge-invariant variables. Then we find an analytical formula for the
pulsar timing rms response to each polarization mode. To estimate the
sensitivity of a single pulsar timing we focus on the case of a dispersion
relation of a massive particle. The sensitivity curves of the scalar
longitudinal and vector polarization modes change significantly depending on the
value of the effective mass. The detection (or absence of detection) of the
polarization modes using the pulsar timing technique has decisive implications
for alternative theories of gravity. Finally, investigating a cutoff frequency
in the pulsar timing band can lead to a more stringent bound on the graviton
mass than that presented by ground-based interferometers.},

different scenarios. In this way, we can test gravity theories in the radiative
regime in a generalized fashion, and such method is a direct experiment, where
one can address the gauge symmetry of the gravity theories in their linearised

polarization data from Planck favor a spatially closed Universe with curvature
parameter $\Omega_K<0$ has been the subject of recent intense discussions.
Attempts to break the geometrical degeneracy combining Planck data with external
datasets such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements all point
towards a spatially flat Universe, at the cost of significant tensions with
Planck, which make the resulting dataset combination problematic. Settling this
issue requires identifying a dataset which can break the geometrical degeneracy
while not incurring in these tensions. We argue that cosmic chronometers (CC),
measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ from the relative ages of massive
early-type passively evolving galaxies, are the dataset we are after.
Furthermore, CC come with the additional advantage of being virtually free of
cosmological model assumptions. Combining Planck 2018 CMB temperature and
polarization data with the latest CC measurements, we break the geometrical
degeneracy and find $\Omega_K=-0.0054 \pm 0.0055$, consistent with a spatially
flat Universe and competitive with the Planck+BAO constraint. Our results are
stable against minimal parameter space extensions and CC systematics, and we
find no substantial tension between Planck and CC data within a non-flat
Universe, making the resulting combination reliable. Our results allow us to
assert with confidence that the Universe is spatially flat to the ${\cal

search for new physics by searching for a stochastic gravitational wave

parameters encoded in the stochastic background produced by a phase transition,
using the sound shell model to characterise the gravitational wave power
spectrum, and the Fisher matrix to estimate uncertainties. We explore a

100$ GeV, with mean bubble spacings $0.1$ and $0.01$ of the Hubble length, and
sound speed $c/\sqrt{3}$. We show that the power spectrum in the sound shell
model can be well approximated by a four-parameter double broken power law, and
find that the peak power and frequency can be measured to approximately 10%
accuracy for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) above 20. Determinations of the
underlying thermodynamic parameters are complicated by degeneracies, but in all
cases the phase boundary speed will be the best constrained parameter. Turning
to the principal components of the Fisher matrix, a signal-to-noise ratio above
20 produces a relative uncertainty less than 3% in the two highest-order
principal components, indicating good prospects for combinations of parameters.
The highest-order principal component is dominated by the wall speed. These

  abstract = {Since WMAP and Planck some anomalous features appeared in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) large-angle anisotropy, the so-called anomalies. One of these
is the hemispherical power asymmetry, i.e. a difference in the average power on
the two hemispheres centered around (l, b) = (221, -20), which shows a
relatively high level of significance. Such an anomaly could be the signature of
a departure from statistical isotropy on large scales. Here we investigate the
physical origin of this anomaly using the Cosmological Gravitational Wave
Background (CGWB) detectable by future GW detectors. Indeed, the CGWB offers a
unique window to explore the early universe and we show that it can be used in
combination with CMB data to shed light on the statistical isotropy of our
universe. Specifically, we study the evolution of gravitons in the presence of a
modulating field in the scalar gravitational potentials accounting for the
hemispherical power asymmetry and we infer the amplitude of this modulating
field through a minimal variance estimator exploiting both constrained and
unconstrained realizations of the CGWB. We show that the addition of the CGWB
will allow an improvement in the assessment of the physical origin of the CMB
power asymmetry. Accounting for the expected performances of LISA and BBO, we
also show that the latter is expected to be signal-dominated on large-scales,
proving that the CGWB could be the keystone to assess the significance of this
anomaly.},

model of the Universe. In the era of precision cosmology, when stress tests of
the standard model are uncovering various tensions and possible anomalies, it is
critical to check the viability of this principle. A key test is the consistency
between the kinematic dipoles of the cosmic microwave background and of the
large-scale matter distribution. Results using radio continuum and quasar
samples indicate a rough agreement in the directions of the two dipoles, but a
larger than expected amplitude of the matter dipole. The resulting tension with
the radiation dipole has been estimated at $\sim 5\sigma$ for some cases,
suggesting a potential new cosmological tension and a possible violation of the
CP. However, the standard formalism for predicting the dipole in the two-
dimensional projection of sources overlooks possible evolution effects in the
luminosity function. In fact, radial information from the luminosity function is
necessary for a correct projection of the three-dimensional source distribution.
Using a variety of current models of the quasar luminosity function, we show
that neglecting redshift evolution can significantly overestimate the relative
velocity amplitude. While the models we investigate are consistent with each
other and with current data, the dipole derived from these, which depends on
derivatives of the luminosity function, can disagree by more than $3\sigma$.
This theoretical systematic bias needs to be resolved before robust conclusions
can be made about a new cosmic tension.},

derived from the CMB, thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here we
present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various

presence of a dipole in the distribution of quasars with a direction that is
consistent with the dipole identified in the CMB. However, the amplitude of the
dipole is found to be 2.7 times larger than that expected from the conventional
kinematic explanation of the CMB dipole, with a statistical significance of
$5.7\sigma$. To compare these results with theoretical expectations, we sharpen
the $\Lambda$CDM predictions for the probability distribution of the amplitude,
taking into account a number of observational and theoretical systematics. In
particular, we show that the presence of the Galactic plane mask causes a
considerable loss of dipole signal due to a leakage of power into higher
multipoles, exacerbating the discrepancy in the amplitude. By contrast, we show
using probabilistic arguments that the source evolution of quasars improves the
discrepancy, but only mildly so. These results support the original findings of
an anomalously large quasar dipole, independent of the statistical methodology

over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated
and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally
coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential
$V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis
of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological
observations, to constrain the model's parameters and to compare its goodness of
fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence
model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial
curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The
significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and
$\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$
is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and
$0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for
the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively,
which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain
$\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive
$\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences
between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy
equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL)
parametrization, as well as a few caveats to our results.},

DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM,
in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in
\cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note
that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM
model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated
expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM
constraints, we observe that the LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent
outlier, a distinction now held jointly with ELG1, LRG2 switches from smaller to
larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the
relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot
restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or ELG1 or
LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has the greatest bearing
on $w_0 > -1$. We conclude that BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend
is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there
may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.},

redshift coverage of the DR2 dataset the preference for dynamical dark energy
does not decrease and remains at approximately the same statistical significance
as for DESI~DR1. Employing both a shape-function reconstruction and non-
parametric methods with a correlation prior derived from Horndeski theory, we
consistently find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with
redshift. While DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data alone provide modest constraints,
combining them with independent SNe samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and the DES
5-year survey) and a CMB distance prior strengthens the evidence for dynamical
dark energy. Bayesian model-selection tests show moderate support for dark
energy dynamics when multiple degrees of freedom in $w(z)$ are allowed, pointing
to increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at a level of roughly $3\sigma$ (or more
in certain data combinations). Although the methodology adopted in this work is
different from those used in companion DESI papers, we find consistent results,
demonstrating the complementarity of dark energy studies performed by the DESI

considered, it currently seems implausible that $\Lambda$CDM will be rescued by
future high-precision surveys, such as the complete DESI, Euclid, and next-

expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy
$V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2<0$. Furthermore, and
more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-

time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the
existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe
such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-

dark matter (DM) for the later mild acceleration. In this scenario, two phases
of BEC (=DE) and normal gas (=DM) transform with each other through BEC phase
transition. This unified model has successfully explained the mild acceleration
as an attractor. We extend this BEC cosmology to the early universe without
introducing new ingredients. In this scenario, the inflation is naturally
initiated by the condensation of the bosons in the huge vacuum energy. This
inflation and even the cosmic expansion eventually terminates exactly at zero
energy density. We call this stage as stagflation. At this stagflation era,
particle production and the decay of BEC take place. The former makes the
universe turn into the standard hot big bang stage and the latter makes the
cosmological constant vanishingly small after the inflation. Furthermore, we
calculate the density fluctuations produced in this model, which turns out to be
in the range allowed by the present observational data. We also show that the
stagflation is quite robust and easily appears when one allows negative region
of the potential. Further, we comment on the possibility that BEC

we develop a method to model galaxy power spectrum in the weakly nonlinear
regime for a mixed dark matter (CDM plus finite-mass neutrinos) model, based on
perturbation theory (PT) whose validity is well tested by simulations for a CDM
model. In doing this we carefully study various aspects of the nonlinear
clustering and then arrive at a useful approximation allowing for a quick
computation of the nonlinear power spectrum as in the CDM case. The nonlinear
galaxy bias is also included in a self-consistent manner within the PT
framework. Thus the use of our PT model can give a more robust understanding of
the measured galaxy power spectrum as well as allow for higher sensitivity to
neutrino masses due to the gain of Fourier modes beyond the linear regime. Based
on the Fisher matrix formalism, we find that BOSS or Stage-III type survey, when
combined with Planck CMB information, gives a precision of total neutrino mass
constraint, sigma(m_nu,tot) 0.1eV, while Stage-IV type survey may achieve
sigma(m_nu,tot) 0.05eV, i.e. more than a 1-sigma detection of neutrino masses.
We also discuss possible systematic errors on dark energy parameters caused by
the neutrino mass uncertainty. The significant correlation between neutrino mass
and dark energy parameters is found, if the information on power spectrum
amplitude is included. More importantly, for Stage-IV type survey, a best-fit
dark energy model may be biased and falsely away from the underlying true model
by more than the 1-sigma statistical errors, if neutrino mass is ignored in the
model fitting.},

combined with the matter power spectrum of SDSS and 2dFGRS, the limit on the
present value of the neutrino mass is $m_0 \equiv m_{\nu}(z=0) < 0.43 (0.28)$ eV
at 95% C.L. for the case in which the neutrino mass was lighter (heavier) in the
past, a result competitive with the ones imposed for standard (i.e., constant
mass) neutrinos. Moreover, for the ratio of the mass variation of the neutrino
mass $\Delta m_{\nu}$ over the current mass $m_0$ we found that $\log[|\Delta
m_{\nu}|/m_0] < -1.3 (-2.7)$ at 95% C.L. for $\Delta m_{\nu} < 0 (\Delta m_{\nu}
> 0)$, totally consistent with no mass variation. These stringent bounds on the
mass variation are not related to the neutrino free-streaming history which may
affect the matter power spectrum on small scales. On the contrary, they are
imposed by the fact that any significant transfer of energy between the neutrino

large scale structure data on the largest observable scales.},

N_eff, is allowed to vary, we find N_eff = 3.4 -0.5 +0.6 (68.3 per cent
confidence, incorporating a direct constraint on the Hubble parameter from
Cepheid and supernova data). We also obtain results with additional degrees of
freedom in the cosmological model, in the form of global spatial curvature
(Omega_k) and a primordial spectrum of tensor perturbations (r and n_t). The
results are not immune to these generalizations; however, in the most general
case we consider, in which M_nu, N_eff, curvature and tensors are all free, we

background (CMB) is a powerful means of constraining the summed mass of neutrino
species sum(m_nu), but is subject to systematic uncertainties due to non-linear
structure formation, redshift-space distortions and galaxy bias. We empirically
test the robustness of neutrino mass results to these effects by separately
analyzing power spectra of red and blue galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS-II) Data Release 7 (DR7), combined with the CMB five-year Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP5) data. We consider fitting for a range of
maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy bias models. For example,
using a new model based on perturbation theory and including redshift space
distortions (Saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy power spectrum combined with
WMAP5 for a wavenumber range of k<0.2 Mpc/h yields 95% CL sum(m_nu)<0.46 eV. The
red and blue galaxy power spectra give 0.41 and 0.63 eV respectively for this
model. Using mock catalogues, we find the expected difference in these limits
assuming a true neutrino mass of zero is 0.10 + or - 0.14 eV. Thus the
difference of 0.22 eV between upper limits on neutrino mass for red and blue
galaxies is approximately 1 sigma from the expected value. We find similar
results for the other models and k ranges tested. This indicates good agreement
for current data but hints at possible issues for next-generation surveys. Being
able to perform such systematic tests is advantageous, and future surveys would
benefit by including broad galaxy populations and luminosities that enable such
a decomposition.},

mainly through the fifth force, a velocity-dependent force that acts parallel to
particle's direction of motion and proportional to its speed, an effective
rescaling of the particle masses, and a modified background expansion rate. In
many cases these effects entangle and it is difficult to see which is the
dominant one. Here we perform N-body simulations to study their qualitative
behaviour and relative importance in affecting the key structure formation
observables, for a model with exponential scalar field coupling. We find that
the fifth force, a prominent example of the scalar-coupling effects, is far less
important than the rescaling of particle mass or the modified expansion rate. In
particular, the rescaling of particle masses is shown to be the key factor
leading to less concentration of particles in halos than in LCDM, a pattern
which is also observed in previous independent coupled scalar field simulations.},

Oscillations (BAO), while marginalising over the spectral amplitude and the
redshift space distortions. In addition to the cosmological parameters of the

find that combining cluster counts with power spectrum information greatly

cosmological parameters being reduced by up to an order of magnitude. In
particular, the best improvements are for the parameters defining the dynamical
evolution of dark energy, where cluster counts break degeneracies. Moreover, the

However, our results indicate that the scale-dependence in the bias is reduced

whether scale-dependent bias really comes from purely neutrino's effect or from
nonlinear gravitational collapse of haloes. For this purpose, we address the
$\Omega_\nu$-$\sigma_8$ degeneracy and find that such degeneracy is not perfect,
implying that neutrinos imprint a slight scale dependence on the large-scale
bias. Finally, by using a simple halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, we
investigate the impact of massive neutrinos on the distribution of galaxies
within dark matter haloes. We use the main galaxy sample in the Sloan Digital

analysis we rely on to the most recent calibration of massive neutrino effects

either active or sterile, is achieved combining cluster or shear data with CMB

sterile neutrino scenario, and for the combination of Planck, BAO, shear and

masses are compatible with CMB bounds from the Planck collaboration.
Interestingly, the combination of Ly$\alpha$ with CMB data reduces the
uncertainties significantly, due to very different directions of degeneracy in
parameter space, leading to the strongest cosmological bound to date on the
total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu < 0.15$~eV at 95\% CL (with a best-fit in
zero). Adding recent BAO results further tightens this constraint to $\sum m_\nu
< 0.14$~eV at 95\% CL. This bound is nearly independent of the statistical
approach used, and of the different combinations of CMB and BAO data sets
considered in this paper in addition to Ly$\alpha$. Given the measured values of

survey yielded tight constraints on cosmological parameters and the statistics
of the density fluctuations at the time of recombination. This provides the
means for a critical study of structure formation in the Universe by comparing
the microwave background results with present epoch measurements of the cosmic
large-scale structure. It can reveal subtle effects such as how different forms
of Dark Matter may modify structure growth. Currently most interesting is the
damping effect of structure growth by massive neutrinos. Different observations
of low redshift matter density fluctuations provided evidence for a signature of
massive neutrinos. Here we discuss the study of the cosmic large-scale structure
with a complete sample of nearby, X-ray luminous clusters from our REFLEX
cluster survey. From the observed X-ray luminosity function and its reproduction
for different cosmological models, we obtain tight constraints on the
cosmological parameters describing the matter density, Omega_m, and the density
fluctuation amplitude, sigma_8. A comparison of these constraints with the
Planck results shows a discrepancy in the framework of a pure LambdaCDM model,
but the results can be reconciled, if we allow for a neutrino mass in the range
of 0.17 to 0.7 eV. Also some others, but not all of the observations of the
nearby large-scale structure provide evidence or trends for signatures of
massive neutrinos. With further improvement in the systematics and future survey
projects, these indications will develop into a definitive measurement of
neutrino masses.},

m_\nu < 0.14$ eV (95\% C.L.).   With their sensitivity to small scales,
Ly$\alpha$ data are ideal to constrain $\Lambda$WDM models. Using XQ-100 alone,

constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses, $\Sigma m_\nu$, through Bayesian
inference. Because these constraints depend on the choice for the prior

fundamental physical principles rather than the ad hoc choices that are common
in the literature. The first step in this direction is to specify the prior
directly at the level of the neutrino mass matrix $M_\nu$, since this is the
parameter appearing in the Lagrangian of the particle physics theory. Thus by
specifying a probability distribution over $M_\nu$, and by including the known
squared mass splittings, we predict a theoretical probability distribution over
$\Sigma m_\nu$ that we interpret as a Bayesian prior probability $\pi(\Sigma
m_\nu)$. We find that $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$ peaks close to the smallest $\Sigma
m_\nu$ allowed by the measured mass splittings, roughly $0.06 \, {\rm eV}$ ($0.1
\, {\rm eV}$) for normal (inverted) ordering, due to the phenomenon of
eigenvalue repulsion in random matrices. We consider three models for neutrino
mass generation: Dirac, Majorana, and Majorana via the seesaw mechanism;
differences in the predicted priors $\pi(\Sigma m_\nu)$ allow for the
possibility of having indications about the physical origin of neutrino masses

redshift surveys. Massive neutrinos modify the expansion rate of the Universe,
which can be measured using baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) or the Alcock-
Paczynski (AP) test. Massive neutrinos also change the structure growth rate and
the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, which can be measured using
redshift-space distortions (RSD). We use the Fisher matrix formalism to
disentangle these information sources, to provide projected neutrino mass
constraints from each of these probes alone and to determine how sensitive each
is to the assumed cosmological model. We isolate the distinctive effect of
neutrino free-streaming on the matter power spectrum and structure growth rate
as a signal unique to massive neutrinos that can provide the most robust
constraints, which are relatively insensitive to extensions to the cosmological
model beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We also provide forecasted constraints using all of
the information contained in the observed galaxy power spectrum combined, and
show that these maximally optimistic constraints are primarily limited by the
accuracy to which the optical depth of the cosmic microwave background, $\tau$,
is known.},

accounting for massive neutrinos, it has already been proved to be independent
from bias and redshift space distortions on a range of linear scales. It
therefore allows for a direct comparison of measurements (from galaxies in
redshift space) to predictions (for matter in real space). In this paper we
first extend the applicability of such properties of the clustering ratio to
cosmologies that include massive neutrinos, by performing tests against
simulated data. We then investigate the constraining power of the clustering
ratio when cosmological parameters such as the total neutrino mass and the
equation of state of dark energy are left free. We analyse the joint posterior
distribution of the parameters that must satisfy, at the same time, the
measurements of the galaxy clustering ratio in the SDSS DR12, and the angular
power spectrum of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB measured
by the Planck satellite. We find the clustering ratio to be very sensitive to
the CDM density parameter, but not very much so to the total neutrino mass.
Lastly, we forecast the constraining power the clustering ratio will achieve
with forthcoming surveys, predicting the amplitude of its errors in a Euclid-
like galaxy survey. In this case, we find it is expected to improve the
constraint at 95% level on the CDM density by 40% and on the total neutrino mass

non-zero scale-dependence at moderate significance, which suggests that a proper
modeling of $b(k)$ is necessary in order to reduce the impact of non-linearities

constraining power of $P_{gg}(k)$ is demonstrated by determining a 95% C.L.

on the optical depth to reionization from 2016 Planck Intermediate results. We
constrain cosmological parameters in $\Lambda CDM$ model with 3 massive active

close to the minimum required mass of $\sum m_{\nu} \simeq$ 0.1 eV for inverted

r, the tensor to scalar ratio ($\Lambda CDM+r+\sum m_{\nu}$ model), and add an

Light from a supernova propagates through a perturbed Universe so the luminosity
distance is modified from its homogeneous prediction. This modification is
proportional to the matter density fluctuation and its time derivative due to
gravitational lensing and peculiar velocity respectively. At low redshifts, the
peculiar velocity signal dominates while at high redshifts lensing does. We show
that using lensing and peculiar velocity of supernovae from the upcoming surveys

current observations. We employ two typical IDE models, the interacting $w$ cold
dark matter (I$w$CDM) model and the interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE)

parameterized post-Friedmann approach to calculate the cosmological
perturbations in the IDE models. The cosmological observational data used in
this work include the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies

direct measurement of the Hubble constant, the weak lensing data, the redshift-
space distortion data, and the CMB lensing data. We find that the dark energy
properties could influence the constraint limits of active neutrino mass and
sterile neutrino parameters in the IDE models. We also find that the dark energy
properties could influence the constraints on the coupling strength parameter
$\beta$, and a positive coupling constant, $\beta>0$, can be detected at the
$2.5\sigma$ statistical significance for the IHDE+$\nu_s$ model by using the
all-data combination. In addition, we also discuss the "Hubble tension" issue in
these scenarios. We find that the $H_0$ tension can be effectively relieved by
considering massive sterile neutrinos, and in particular in the IHDE+$\nu_s$
model the $H_0$ tension can be reduced to be at the $1.28\sigma$ level.},

vacuum energy is interacting with cold dark matter throughout the cosmic

Planck 2018 release. In addition to this minimal scenario, we generalize the
model baseline by including the properties of neutrinos, such as the neutrino
mass scale ($M_{\nu}$) and the effective number of neutrino species ($N_{\rm
eff}$) as free parameters, in order to verify the possible effects that such
parameters might generate on the coupling parameter, and vice versa. As already
known, we again confirm that in light of the Planck 2018 data, such dark
coupling can successfully solve the $H_0$ tension (with and without the presence
of neutrinos). Concerning the properties of neutrinos, we find that $M_{\nu}$
may be wider than expected within the $\Lambda$CDM model and $N_{\rm eff}$ is
fully compatible with three neutrino species (similar to $\Lambda$CDM
prevision). The parameters characterizing the properties of neutrinos do not
correlate with the coupling parameter of the interaction model. When considering
the joint analysis of CMB from Planck 2018 and an estimate of $H_0$ from Hubble
Space Telescope 2019 data, {\it we find an evidence for a non-null value of the

possible effects on the interacting scenario due to the inclusion of baryon
acoustic oscillations data with Planck 2018. Our main results updating the dark
sectors' interaction and neutrino properties in the model baseline, represent a
new perspective in this direction. Clearly, a possible new physics in light of
some dark interaction between dark energy and dark matter can serve as an
alternative to $\Lambda$CDM scenario to explain the observable Universe, mainly
in light of the current tension on $H_0$.},

Uncertainties due to baryonic effects associated with galaxy formation and
evolution, including gas cooling, star formation, and feedback from active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and supernovae, have typically been neglected when
forecasting the sensitivity of future CMB surveys. In this paper, we determine
the impact of these effects using four suites of hydrodynamical simulations
which incorporate various prescriptions for baryonic processes, namely OWLS,
BAHAMAS, Horizon, and IllustrisTNG. Our analysis shows characteristic power
suppressions of several percent in CMB lensing due to baryonic effects, compared
to dark-matter only simulations, at experimentally observable angular scales. We
investigate the associated bias in the inferred neutrino mass for experiments
like the upcoming Simons Observatory and CMB-S4. Depending on the experimental
precision and the strength of the baryonic feedback within the simulations,
biases in the neutrino mass sum show significant dispersion, ranging from very
small to an over-estimation by 1.1$\sigma$. We conclude that baryonic effects
will likely be non-negligible for a detection of neutrino mass using CMB
lensing.},

effects ought to be included. Here we forecast, via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
likelihood analysis, whether measurements by two galaxy surveys: DESI and {\it
Euclid}, when added to the CMB-S4 experiment, are sensitive to two effects that
can alter neutrino-mass measurements. The first is the slight difference in the
suppression of matter fluctuations that each neutrino-mass hierarchy generates,
at fixed total mass. The second is the growth-induced scale-dependent bias
(GISDB) of haloes produced by massive neutrinos. We find that near-future
surveys can distinguish hierarchies with the same total mass only at the
$1\sigma$ level; thus, while these are poised to deliver a measurement of the
sum of neutrino masses, they cannot significantly discern the mass of each
individual neutrino in the foreseeable future. We further find that neglecting
the GISDB induces up to a $1\sigma$ overestimation of the total neutrino mass,
and we show how to absorb this effect via a redshift-dependent parametrization
of the scale-independent bias.},

this study we first update cosmological bounds on the mass and energy density of
eV-scale sterile neutrinos. We then perform an updated study of a previously
proposed model in which the sterile neutrino couples to a new light pseudoscalar
degree of freedom. Consistently with previous analyses, we find that the model
provides a good fit to all cosmological data and allows the high value of $H_0$
measured in the local universe to be consistent with measurements of the cosmic
microwave background. However, new high $\ell$ polarisation data constrain the
sterile neutrino mass to be less than approximately 1 eV in this scenario.
Finally, we combine the cosmological bounds on the pseudoscalar model with a
Bayesian inference analysis of SBL data and conclude that only a sterile mass in
narrow ranges around 1 eV remains consistent with both cosmology and SBL data.},

it is measured by BOSS. We show that, by marginalizing over the model parameters
that capture the impact of the intergalactic medium, the flux power spectrum

model displays a degeneracy between the neutrino masses and the (unknown, in our
formalism) normalization of the flux power spectrum. This degeneracy can be
lifted by calibrating one of the model parameters with simulation data, and
using input from Planck CMB data. We demonstrate that this approach can be used
to extract bounds on the sum of neutrino masses with comparably low numerical
effort, while allowing for a conservative treatment of uncertainties from the
dynamics of the intergalactic medium. An explorative analysis yields an upper

two new stochastic parameters. These additional nuisance parameters appreciably
weaken the constraints on $M_\nu$. CMB lensing plays a significant role in
helping to alleviate these degeneracies and tighten the final constraints. The
constraint on the optical depth to reionisation $\tau$ has a strong effect on
the constraint on $M_\nu$, but only when CMB lensing is included in the analysis

extract constraints when 1) using the BAO signature only as a distance probe,
and 2) isolating the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, which, as shown in
previous work, provides a cosmology-independent probe of $M_\nu$. All
constraints except the latter remain strongly sensitive to the assumption of a
flat $\Lambda$CDM universe. We perform an analysis of the magnitude of the shift
introduced in the inferred $M_\nu$ value when neglecting nonlinear corrections,
and show that, for a Euclid-like survey, this shift becomes roughly equal to the

the production and detection in general gravitational setting. In the weak
gravity limit, the proper time between two events of given proper distance is
smaller than that in the flat spacetime. Therefore, in presence of a
Schwarzschild object, the neutrino wave packets have to travel relatively more
physical distance in space to lapse the same amount of proper time before they
decoher. For non-radial propagation applicable to the lensing phenomena, we show
that the decoherence, in general, is sensitive to the absolute values of
neutrino masses as well as the classical trajectories taken by neutrinos between
the source and detector along with the spatial widths of neutrino wave packets.
At distances beyond the decoherence length, the probability of neutrino flavour
transition due to lensing attains a value which depends only on the leptonic
mixing parameters. Hence, the observability of neutrino lensing significantly
depends on these parameters and in-turn the lensing can provide useful
information about them.},

provide a unique connection between the cosmic neutrino background, which is
detected gravitationally, and neutrinos measured on Earth. We then discuss how

attention in the cosmology literature recently since it can give important
complementary information to Bayesian credible intervals. Here, we give a
pedagogical review of frequentist parameter inference in cosmology and focus on
when the graphical profile likelihood construction gives meaningful constraints,
i.e. confidence intervals with correct coverage. This construction rests on the
assumption of the asymptotic limit of a large data set such as in Wilks'
theorem. We assess the validity of this assumption in the context of three
cosmological models with Planck 2018 Plik_lite data: While our tests for the
$\Lambda$CDM model indicate that the profile likelihood method gives correct
coverage, $\Lambda$CDM with the sum of neutrino masses as a free parameter
appears consistent with a Gaussian near a boundary motivating the use of the
boundary-corrected or Feldman-Cousins graphical method; for $w_0$CDM with the
equation of state of dark energy, $w_0$, as a free parameter, we find indication
of a violation of the assumptions. Finally, we compare frequentist and Bayesian
constraints of these models. Our results motivate care when using the graphical
profile likelihood method in cosmology. Along with this paper, we publish our
profile-likelihood code "pinc".},

the Universe and the growth of structure, both of which are degenerate with the
late-time expansion history. We clarify the nature of these degeneracies and the
individual roles of both probes in neutrino mass inference. Geometry is strongly
sensitive to neutrino masses: within $\Lambda$CDM, the primary cosmic microwave
background anisotropies alone impose that the matter fraction $\Omega_m$ must
increase fivefold with increasing neutrino mass. Moreover, large-scale structure
observables, like weak lensing of the CMB, are dimensionless and thus depend not
on the matter density (as often quoted) but in fact the matter fraction. We
explore the consequential impact of this distinction on the interplay between
probes of structure, low-redshift distances, and CMB anisotropies. We derive
constraints on the neutrino's masses independently from their suppression of
structure and impact on geometry, showing that the latter is at least as
important as the former. While the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's recent
baryon acoustic oscillation data place stringent bounds largely deriving from
their geometric incompatibility with massive neutrinos, all recent type Ia
supernova datasets drive marginal preferences for nonzero neutrino masses
because they prefer substantially larger matter fractions. Recent CMB lensing
data, however, neither exclude neutrinos' suppression of structure nor constrain
it strongly enough to discriminate between mass hierarchies. Current data thus
evince not a need for modified dynamics of neutrino perturbations or structure
growth but rather an inconsistent compatibility with massive neutrinos' impact
on the expansion history. We identify two of DESI's measurements that strongly
influence its constraints, and we also discuss neutrino mass measurements in
models that alter the sound horizon.},

21-cm forest as a tool for measuring neutrino mass, given that the temperature

followed as they rose through several ICM scale heights. Such bubbles quickly
evolve into a toroidal form that, in the absence of magnetic influences, is
stable against fragmentation in our simulations. This ring formation results
from (commonly used) initial conditions that cause ICM material below the
bubbles to drive upwards through the bubble, creating a vortex ring; that is,
hydrostatic bubbles develop into "smoke rings", if they are initially not very
much smaller or very much larger than the ICM scale height. Even modest ICM
magnetic fields with beta = P_gas/P_mag ~ 10^3 can influence the dynamics of the
bubbles, provided the fields are not tangled on scales comparable to or smaller
than the size of the bubbles. Quasi-uniform, horizontal fields with initial beta
~ 10^2 bifurcated our bubbles before they rose more than about a scale height of
the ICM, and substantially weaker fields produced clear distortions. On the
other hand, tangled magnetic fields with similar, modest strengths are generally
less easily amplified by the bubble motions and are thus less influential in
bubble evolution. Inclusion of a comparably strong, tangled magnetic field

those fields were quickly diminished through expansion of the bubble and

The deviation from the Gaussian halo mass function is in reasonable agreement
with the theoretical predictions. The scale-dependent bias correction Delta
b_kappa(k,gnl) measured from the auto- and cross-power spectrum of haloes, is
similar to the correction in fnl models, but the amplitude is lower than
theoretical expectations. Using the compilation of LSS data in Slosar et al.

+8.2*10^5 (at 95% CL). This limit will improve with the future LSS data by 1-2

test of inflation. In this paper we calculate the modification of two-point
cross-correlation statistics of weak lensing - galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) cross-correlation - due to fNL. We derive and
calculate the covariance matrix of galaxy-galaxy lensing including cosmic
variance terms. We focus on large scales (l<100) for which the shape noise of
the shear measurement becomes irrelevant and cosmic variance dominates the error
budget. For a modest degree of non-Gaussianity, fNL=+/-50, modifications of the
galaxy-galaxy lensing signal at the 10% level are seen on scales R~300 Mpc, and
grow rapidly toward larger scales as \propto R^2. We also see a clear signature
of the baryonic acoustic oscillation feature in the matter power spectrum at
~150 Mpc, which can be measured by next-generation lensing experiments. In
addition we can probe the local-form primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy-
CMB lensing signal by correlating the lensing potential reconstructed from CMB
with high-z galaxies. For example, for fNL=+/-50, we find that the galaxy-CMB
lensing cross power spectrum is modified by ~10% at l~40, and by a factor of two
at l~10, for a population of galaxies at z=2 with a bias of 2. The effect is
greater for more highly biased populations at larger z; thus, high-z galaxy

into what is meant to be a probe of the largest scales. Previously, we developed
an optimal ``minimum variance'' (MV) weighting scheme, designed to overcome this
problem by minimizing the difference between the measured bulk flow (BF) and
that which would be measured by an ideal survey. Here we extend this MV analysis
to include the shear and octupole moments, which are designed to have almost no
correlations between them so that they are virtually orthogonal. We apply this
MV analysis to a compilation of all major peculiar velocity surveys, consisting
of 4536 measurements. Our estimate of the BF on scales of ~ 100 Mpc/h has a
magnitude of |v|= 416 +/- 78 km/s towards Galactic l = 282 degree +/- 11 degree
and b = 6 degree +/- 6 degree. This result is in disagreement with LCDM with
WMAP5 cosmological parameters at a high confidence level, but is in good
agreement with our previous MV result without an orthogonality constraint,
showing that the shear and octupole moments did not contaminate the previous BF
measurement. The shear and octupole moments are consistent with WMAP5 power
spectrum, although the measurement noise is larger for these moments than for
the BF. The relatively low shear moments suggest that the sources responsible
for the BF are at large distances.},

investigate this process and its dependence on the baryonic physics associated
with galaxy formation. The inclusion of baryons results in significantly more
concentrated density profiles if radiative cooling is efficient and feedback is
weak. The dark matter halo concentration can in that case increase by as much as
30 (10) per cent on galaxy (cluster) scales. The most significant effects occur
in galaxies at high redshift, where there is a strong anti-correlation between
the baryon fraction in the halo centre and the inner slope of both the total and
the dark matter density profiles. If feedback is weak, isothermal inner profiles
form, in agreement with observations of massive, early-type galaxies. However,
we find that AGN feedback, or extremely efficient feedback from massive stars,
is necessary to match observed stellar fractions in groups and clusters, as well
as to keep the maximum circular velocity similar to the virial velocity as
observed for disk galaxies. These strong feedback models reduce the baryon
fraction in galaxies by a factor of 3 relative to the case with no feedback. The
AGN is even capable of reducing the baryon fraction by a factor of 2 in the
inner region of group and cluster haloes. This in turn results in inner density
profiles which are typically shallower than isothermal and the halo

which complement the stringent constraints on the power spectrum normalization,
\sigma_8, from the number counts. To quantify the joint constraints on theese
two parameters, that specify the timing of structure formation for a fixed

quadratic in the local tidal field, which may be applicable to disc galaxies. We
compute the correction to the redshift-space bispectrum in the quasilinear

transverse bispectrum, i.e. using triangles in the plane of the sky. We show
that in the linear alignment model, intrinsic alignments result in an error in
the galaxy bias parameters, but do not affect the inferred value of sigma_8. In

Depending on the functional form of the coupling strength, these models show a
range of possible intermediate behaviors between the standard LCDM background
evolution and the widely studied case of interacting dark energy models with a
constant coupling. These different background evolutions play a crucial role in
the growth of cosmic structures, and determine strikingly different effects of
the coupling on the internal dynamics of nonlinear objects. By means of a
suitable modification of the cosmological N-body code GADGET-2 we have performed
a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of structure formation in the
context of interacting dark energy models with variable couplings. Depending on
the type of background evolution, the halo density profiles are found to be
either less or more concentrated with respect to LCDM, contrarily to what
happens for constant coupling models where concentrations can only decrease.
However, for some specific choice of the interaction function the reduction of
halo concentrations can be larger than in constant coupling scenarios. In
general, we find that time dependent interactions between dark energy and CDM
can in some cases determine stronger effects on structure formation as compared
to the constant coupling case, with a significantly weaker impact on the

possibility to alleviate the tensions between observations and the LCDM model on

hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the non-linear effects that massive

quantify the difference with respect to the concordance LambdaCDM model of the

modified gravity. Future nearly all-sky spectroscopic galaxy surveys will be
able to constrain the neutrino mass if it is larger than 0.6 eV, using beta
measurements alone and independently of the value of the matter power spectrum
normalisation. In combination with other cosmological probes, this will
strengthen neutrino mass constraints and help breaking parameter degeneracies.},

fixed redshift. The fact that the most massive clusters probe the high-mass tail
of the mass function, where the difference between LCDM and alternative
cosmological models is strongest, makes our method particularly interesting as a
cosmological probe. We utilise general extreme value statistics (GEV) to obtain
a cumulative distribution function of the most massive objects in a given
volume. We sample this distribution function according to the number of patches
covered by the survey area for a range of different "test cosmologies" and for
differently accurate mass estimations of the haloes. By fitting this sample with
the GEV distribution function, we can study which parameters are the most
sensitive with respect to the test cosmologies. We find that the peak of the
probability distribution function of the most massive halo is well suited to
test the validity of the fiducial LCDM model, once we are able to establish a
sufficiently complete large-area survey with M_lim=10^14.5 M_sun/h (M_lim=10^14
M_sun/h) at redshifts above z=1 (z=1.5). Being of cumulative nature the proposed
measure is robust and an accuracy of 20-30% in the cluster masses would be
sufficient to test for alternative models. Since one only needs the most massive
system in each angular patch, this method would be ideally suited as a first
fast consistency check before going into a more complex statistical analysis of
the observed halo sample.},

moderate volumes with the cross-correlation of photometric and spectroscopic
surveys. We consider the angular galaxy-galaxy autocorrelation in narrow
redshift bins and its combination with different probes of weak gravitational
lensing (WL) and redshift space distortions (RSD). Including the cross-
correlation of these surveys improves by factors of a few the constraints on
both the dark energy equation of state w(z) and the cosmic growth history,
parametrized by \gamma. The additional information comes from using many narrow
redshift bins and from galaxy bias, which is measured both with WL probes and
RSD, breaking degeneracies that are present when using each method separately.
We show forecasts for a joint w(z) and \gamma figure of merit using linear
scales over a deep (i<24) photometric survey and a brighter (i<22.5)
spectroscopic or very accurate (0.3%) photometric redshift survey. Magnification
or shear in the photometric sample produce FoM that are of the same order of
magnitude of those of RSD or BAO over the spectroscopic sample. However, the
cross-correlation of these probes over the same area yields a FoM that is up to
a factor 100 times larger. Magnification alone, without shape measurements, can
also be used for these cross-correlations and can produce better results than
using shear alone. For a spectroscopic follow-up survey strategy, measuring the
spectra of the foreground lenses to perform this cross-correlation provides 5
times better FoM than targeting the higher redshift tail of the galaxy
distribution to study BAO over a 2.5 times larger volume.},

different smoothing scales for V_0, and through V_1 and V_2, the boundary length

equation only valid for nonrelativistic particles in the MD era. We succeed to
reduce the system of four Volterra integral equations for the density and
anisotropic stress fluctuations of DM and neutrinos into a system of only two

different harmonics. These harmonics couple differently to Silk damping,
altering the form and evolution of acoustic waves in the baryon-photon fluid

correspondence between Newtonian and relativistic dust cosmologies continues to
hold in linearized perturbation theory in the marginally bound/spatially flat
case. Nevertheless, it is far from obvious that Newtonian gravity can provide a
good global description of an inhomogeneous cosmology when there is significant
nonlinear dynamical behavior at small scales. We investigate this issue in the
light of a perturbative framework that we have recently developed, which allows
for such nonlinearity at small scales. We propose a relatively straightforward
"dictionary"---which is exact at the linearized level---that maps Newtonian dust
cosmologies into general relativistic dust cosmologies, and we use our "ordering
scheme" to determine the degree to which the resulting metric and matter
distribution solve Einstein's equation. We find that Einstein's equation fails
to hold at "order 1" at small scales and at "order $\epsilon$" at large scales.
We then find the additional corrections to the metric and matter distribution
needed to satisfy Einstein's equation to these orders. While these corrections
are of some interest in their own right, our main purpose in calculating them is
that their smallness should provide a criterion for the validity of the original
dictionary (as well as simplified versions of this dictionary). We expect that,
in realistic Newtonian cosmologies, these additional corrections will be very

et al. (2011), studying minimum variance moments of the velocity field, as
calculated by Watkins, Feldman & Hudson (2009) and Feldman, Watkins & Hudson
(2010). We find good agreement with the LCDM model on scales of k > 0.01 h
Mpc-1. We find an excess of power on scales of k < 0.01 h Mpc-1, although with a
1 sigma uncertainty which includes the LCDM model. We find that the uncertainty
in the excess at these scales is larger than an alternative result studying only
moments of the velocity field, which is due to the minimum variance weights used
to calculate the moments. At small scales, we are able to clearly discriminate
between linear and nonlinear clustering in simulated peculiar velocity
catalogues, and find some evidence (although less clear) for linear clustering
in the real peculiar velocity data.},

only assumes the canonical scenario for structure formation from the collapse of

maximized in the computation so as to obtain robust constraints on w and on its

complementary to those obtained by combining Supernovae, Cosmic Microwave

combinations of w_0 and w_a leaving the time evolution of the state parameter
w_a highly unconstrained, the BH abundance mainly provide upper limits on w_a,
only weakly depending on w_0. Combined with the existing constraints, our
results significantly restrict the allowed region in DDE parameter space, ruling
out DDE models not providing cosmic time and fast growth factor large enough to
allow for the building up of the observed abundance of BHs; in particular,
models with -1.2 \leq w_0 \leq -1 and positive redshift evolution w_a > 0.8 -

the main purpose of dissecting the cosmological information provided by
geometrical and growth tests, which are both included in the analysis of number
counts and clustering of galaxy clusters. We compare cosmological constraints
obtained by assuming different levels of prior knowledge of the parameters which
define the observable-mass X-ray relation. This comparison further demonstrates
the fundamental importance of having a well calibrated observable-mass relation
and, most importantly, its redshift evolution. Such a calibration can be
achieved only by having at least $\sim 10^3$ net photon counts for each cluster
included in the survey. We show that RSDs in the power spectrum analysis carry
important cosmological information also when traced with galaxy clusters and the
DE FoM increases by a factor of 8. Besides confirming the potential that large
cluster surveys have in constraining the nature of DE, our analysis emphasizes
that a full exploitation of the cosmological information carried by such surveys

spectroscopic redshift survey with configuration parameters close to those of

its running. If we attempt to reconstruct the inflationary single-field

improves the constraints on features by more than a factor of two. In axion

find mild (2.2 sigma) preference for additional light degrees of freedom.
However, the effective number of neutrinos is consistent with the canonical
expectation of 3 massive neutrinos and no extra relativistic species to within 1
sigma when allowing for evolving dark energy and relaxing the strong inflation
prior on the curvature and running. The agreement improves with the possibility
of an early dark energy component, itself constrained to be less than 5% of the
critical density (95% CL) in our expanded parameter space. In extensions of the
standard cosmological model, the derived amplitude of linear matter fluctuations
sigma_8 is found to closely agree with low-redshift cluster abundance
measurements. The sum of neutrino masses is robust to assumptions of the
effective number of neutrinos, late-time dark energy, curvature, and running at
the level of 1.2 eV (95% CL). The upper bound degrades to 2.0 eV (95% CL) when
further including the early dark energy density and primordial helium abundance

Planck alone could determine the possible existence of extra relativistic

cosmology-dependent conversion of redshifts into distances. We use a suite of

dispersion model to fit the anisotropy of the observed correlation function. We
verify that redshift errors up to ~0.2% have a negligible impact on the

redshift errors introduce a positive systematic error, which can be alleviated
by adopting a Gaussian distribution function of pairwise velocities. This is, in
any case, smaller than the systematic error of up to 10% due to the limitations
of the linear dispersion model, which is studied in a separate paper. We then
show that 50% of the statistical error budget on beta depends on the
deprojection procedure through which the real-space correlation function is

Alcock-Paczynski test in redshift-space, which successfully recovers the correct

Euler potentials (divergenceless by definition), which are not able to follow
the winding-up process of magnetic field lines properly. Furthermore, we present
cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster formation at extremely high

rotation maps and derive structure functions to compare them with observations.
Comparing all the simulations with and without divergence cleaning, we are able
to confirm the results of previous simulations performed with the standard

are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The
former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter
halos hosting cluster, their mass function and clustering properties. Their
study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for
testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure
formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar

plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the
observed thermal properties of the intra-cluster plasma exhibit the most regular
behavior and thus can be used to define robust observational proxies for the
total cluster mass. We put particular emphasis on examining assumptions and
limitations of the widely used self-similar model of clusters. Finally, we
discuss the formation of clusters in non-standard cosmological models, such as
non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified

second order measures like the two-point correlation function and power
spectrum, it has the advantage of a considerably lower sensitivity to systematic
influences. Because it lacks a direct dependence on bias if this concerns simple
linear bias, skewness will be considerably less beset by uncertainties due to
galaxy bias. Also, it has a weaker sensitivity to redshift distortion effects.
We use perturbation theory to evaluate the magnitude of the effect on the
volume-average skewness, for various cosmological models. One important finding
of our analysis is that the skewness BAO signal occurs at smaller scales than
that in second order statistics. For an LCDM spectrum with WMAP7 normalization,
the BAO feature has a maximum wiggle amplitude of ~3% and appears at a scale of
~82Mpc/h. We conclude that the detection of BAO wiggles in future extensive
galaxy surveys via the skewness of the observed galaxy distribution may provide
us with a useful, and potentially advantageous, measure of the nature of Dark

galaxies and dark matter is very close to unity on scales outside a few virial
radii of galaxy halos, independent of the details of how galaxies populate dark
matter halos. This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter
clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy
clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on large-
scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We generalise the approach of Baldauf et al.
(2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 Mpc/h for lensing and
clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation coefficient
differs from unity. We derive constraints for three galaxy samples covering 7131
sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with mean redshifts of
0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy bias for the more
luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with theoretical expectations.
When we vary both \sigma_8 and \Omega_m (and marginalise over non-linear galaxy
bias) in a flat LCDM model, the best-constrained quantity is \sigma_8
(\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05 (1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical
and systematic errors have comparable contributions, and we fixed n_s=0.96 and
h=0.7. These strong constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this
method is competitive with cosmic shear in current data, while having very
complementary and in some ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect
that this method will play a prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When
we combine these data with WMAP7 CMB data, constraints on \sigma_8, \Omega_m,
H_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu} become 30--80 per cent tighter than with CMB data
alone, since our data break several parameter degeneracies.},

allow for massive neutrinos, in which case the bound becomes slightly weaker,
{\beta} < 0.084(0.14). A larger value of the effective number of relativistic
degrees of freedom favors larger couplings between dark matter and dark energy
as well as values of the spectral index closer to 1. Adding the present

values from our most generalized constraint read
$\mnu=0.556^{+0.231}_{-0.288}\rm eV$, $\neff=3.839\pm0.452$, and
$w=-1.058\pm0.088$ at 68% confidence level, which shows a firm lower limit on
total neutrino mass, favors an extra light degree of freedom, and supports the
cosmological constant model. The current weak lensing data are already helpful
in constraining cosmological model parameters for fixed $w$. The dataset of
Hubble parameter gains numerous advantages over supernovae when $w=-1$,
particularly its illuminating power in constraining $\neff$. As long as $w$ is

of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) technique and assume two sets of
theoretical errors. The first error is meant to account for uncertainties in the
modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-linear galaxy power spectrum and
we assume this error to be fully correlated in Fourier space. The second error
is meant to parametrize the overall residual uncertainties in modelling the non-
linear galaxy power spectrum at small scales, and is conservatively assumed to
be uncorrelated and to increase with the ratio of a given scale to the scale of
non-linearity. It hence increases with wavenumber and decreases with redshift.
With these two assumptions for the errors and assuming further conservatively
that the uncorrelated error rises above 2% at k = 0.4 h/Mpc and z = 0.5, we find
that a future Euclid-like cosmic shear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-sigma error on
Mnu close to 32 meV/25 meV, sufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass
with good significance. If the residual uncorrelated errors indeed rises rapidly
towards smaller scales in the non-linear regime as we have assumed here then the
data on non-linear scales does not increase the sensitivity to the total
neutrino mass. Assuming instead a ten times smaller theoretical error with the
same scale dependence, the error on the total neutrino mass decreases moderately
from sigma(Mnu) = 18 meV to 14 meV when mildly non-linear scales with 0.1 h/Mpc
< k < 0.6 h/Mpc are included in the analysis of the galaxy survey data.},

significantly improving their constraining power by breaking existing

estimates. We then add the redshift-space power spectrum of the sample,

cone, evolution and Alcock-Paczynski effects - interestingly, the gravitational
redshift term is exactly canceled by some of the others, assuming geodesic
motion. Most of these effects are captured by previous calculations of general
relativistic corrections to the observed galaxy density fluctuation; the
asymmetry arises from terms that are suppressed by the ratio H/k - H is the
Hubble constant and k is the wavenumber - which are more readily observable than
the terms suppressed by (H/k)^2. Some of the contributions to the asymmetry,
however, arise from terms that are generally considered 'Newtonian' - the
lensing and evolution - and thus represent a contaminant in the search for
general relativistic corrections. We propose methods to disentangle these
different contributions. A simple method reduces the contamination to a level of

  abstract = {Research over the past three decades has revolutionized the field of cosmology
while supporting the standard cosmological model. However, the cosmological
principle of Universal homogeneity and isotropy has always been in question,
since structures as large as the survey size have always been found as the
survey size has increased. Until now, the largest known structure in our
Universe is the Sloan Great Wall (SGW), which is more than 400 Mpc long and
located approximately one billion light-years away. Here we report the discovery
of a structure at least six times larger than the Sloan Great Wall that is
suggested by the distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Gamma-ray bursts are
the most energetic explosions in the Universe. They are associated with the
stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found in and near distant galaxies.
Therefore, they are very good indicators of the dense part of the Universe
containing normal matter. As of July 2012, 283 GRB redshifts have been measured.
If one subdivides this GRB sample into nine radial parts and compares the sky
distributions of these subsamples (each containing 31 GRBs), one can observe
that the fourth subsample (1.6 < z < 2.1) differs significantly from the others
in that many of the GRBs are concentrated in the same angular area of the sky.
Using the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the significance of this
observation is found to be less than 0.05 per cent. Fourteen out of the 31
Gamma-Ray Bursts in this redshift band are concentrated in approximately 1/8 of
the sky. The binomial probability to find such a deviation is p=0.0000055. This
huge structure lies ten times farther away than the Sloan Great Wall, at a
distance of approximately ten billion light-years. The size of the structure
defined by these GRBs is about 2000-3000 Mpc, or more than six times the size of
the largest known object (SGW) in the Universe.},

alleviates small-scale issues within the $\Lambda$CDM model, more so even than

large dwarf-size halos ($V_\mathrm{max}$ ~ 30 - 80 km s$^{-1}$) and alleviates
the too-big-to-fail problem significantly compared to our adopted Planck and WDM

relative to Planck models, and yields a significantly lower "boost" factor for
dark matter annihilation signals. Our findings highlight the need to understand

Although the Planck CMB experiment has produced strong limits on non-Gaussianity

redshift galaxy population by running five cosmological N-body simulations down
to z=6.5. For these simulations, we adopt the same initial phases, and either
Gaussian or scale-dependent non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations, all consistent
with the constraints set by Planck on clusters scales. We then assign stellar
masses to each halo using the halo - stellar mass empirical relation of Behroozi
et al. (2013). Our simulations with non-Gaussian initial conditions produce halo
mass functions that show clear departures from those obtained from the analogous
simulations with Gaussian initial conditions at z>~10. We observe a >0.3 dex
enhancement of the low-end of the halo mass function, which leads to a similar
effect on the galaxy stellar mass function, which should be testable with future
galaxy surveys at z>10. As cosmic reionization is thought to be driven by dwarf
galaxies at high redshift, our findings may have implications for the
reionization history of the Universe.},

statistical isotropy in our Universe, as well as characteristic four-point
correlations in the current mass distribution in the Universe. So far, the
predictions for these observables have been worked out only for single-clock
models in which certain consistency conditions between the tensor-scalar-scalar
correlation and tensor and scalar power spectra are satisfied. Here we review
the requirements on inflation models for these consistency conditions to be
satisfied. We then consider several examples of inflation models, such as non-
attractor and solid inflation models, in which these conditions are put to the
test. In solid inflation the simplest consistency conditions are already
violated whilst in the non-attractor model we find that, contrary to the
standard scenario, the tensor-scalar-scalar correlator probes directly relevant
model-dependent information. We work out the predictions for observables in
these models. For non-attractor inflation we find an apparent local quadrupolar
departure from statistical isotropy in large-scale structure but that this power
quadrupole decreases very rapidly at smaller scales. The consistency of the CMB
quadrupole with statistical isotropy then constrains the distance scale that
corresponds to the transition from the non-attractor to attractor phase of
inflation to be larger than the currently observable horizon. Solid inflation
predicts clustering fossils signatures in the current galaxy distribution that
may be large enough to be detectable with forthcoming, and possibly even
current, galaxy surveys.},

cosmic evolution was standard $\Lambda$CDM in the past and that the present
matter density and power spectrum normalization are the same as in a
$\Lambda$CDM model. Here we examine how the constraints change when these
assumptions are lifted. We focus in particular on the parameter $Y$ (also called
$G_{\mathrm{eff}}$) that quantifies the deviation from the Poisson equation.
This parameter can be estimated by comparing with the model-independent growth
rate quantity $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ obtained through redshift distortions. We reduce
the model dependency in evaluating $Y$ by marginalizing over $\sigma_{8}$ and
over the initial conditions, and by absorbing the degenerate parameter
$\Omega_{m,0}$ into $Y$. We use all currently available values of
$f\sigma_{8}(z)$. We find that the combination $\hat{Y}=Y\Omega_{m,0}$, assumed
constant in the observed redshift range, can be constrained only very weakly by
current data, $\hat{Y}=0.28_{-0.23}^{+0.35}$ at 68\% c.l. We also forecast the
precision of a future estimation of $\hat{Y}$ in a Euclid-like redshift survey.
We find that the future constraints will reduce substantially the uncertainty,
$\hat{Y}=0.30_{-0.09}^{+0.08}$ , at 68\% c.l., but the relative error on
$\hat{Y}$ around the fiducial remains quite high, of the order of 30\%. The main
reason for these weak constraints is that $\hat{Y}$ is strongly degenerate with
the initial conditions, so that large or small values of $\hat{Y}$ are
compensated by choosing non-standard initial values of the derivative of the
matter density contrast.   Finally, we produce a forecast of a cosmological
exclusion plot on the Yukawa strength and range parameters, which complements
similar plots on laboratory scales but explores scales and epochs reachable only
with large-scale galaxy surveys. (abridged)},

for their covariance matrices in order to calculate analytically their

Our approach allows the precise quantitative comparison of the techniques with

sufficient statistics. In particular, we find that while the A* power spectrum
has a similar shape to the usual galaxy power spectrum, its amplitude is
strongly modulated by small scale statistics. This effect is mostly responsible
for the ability of the A* power spectrum to recapture the information lost for
the usual power spectrum. We use our framework to forecast the best achievable
cosmological constraints for projected surveys as a function of their galaxy
density, and compare the information content of the two power spectra. We find
that sufficient statistics extract all cosmological information, resulting in an
approximately factor of ~2 gain for dense projected surveys at low redshift.

Dark Energy is a scalar field $\Phi$; its coupling to ancillary CDM, whose
today's density is $\ll 1\, \%$, is an essential model feature. Such coupling,
in fact, allows the formation of cosmic structures, in spite of very low WDM
particle masses ($\sim 100$ eV). SCDEW models yields Cosmic Microwave Background
and linear Large Scale features substantially undistinguishable from
$\Lambda$CDM, but thanks to the very low WDM masses they strongly alleviate
$\Lambda$CDM issues on small scales, as confirmed via numerical simulations in
the II associated paper. Moreover SCDEW cosmologies significantly ease the
coincidence and fine tuning problems of $\Lambda$CDM and, by using a field
theory approach, we also outline possible links with inflationary models. We
also discuss a possible fading of the coupling at low redshifts which prevents
non linearities on the CDM component to cause computational problems. The
(possible) low-$z$ coupling suppression, its mechanism, and its consequences are
however still open questions -not necessarily problems- for SCDEW models. The
coupling intensity and the WDM particle mass, although being extra parameters in

690,826 massive galaxies in the redshift range 0.43-0.7 covering 8498 deg$^2$.
Here we report the first simultaneous measurement of $f\sigma_8$ and background
cosmological parameters using Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (CLPT)

$f\sigma_8=0.462\pm0.041$ (9\% accuracy) at effective redshift ($\bar{z}=0.57$)

$H(z=0.57)=89.2\pm3.6$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $D_A(z=0.57)=1401\pm23$ Mpc.

massive neutrinos, where the scalar field possesses an inverse power-law
potential, i.e., $V(\phi)\propto {\phi}^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha>0$). We find that
the sum of neutrino masses $\Sigma m_{\nu}$ has significant impacts on the CMB
temperature power spectrum and on the matter power spectrum. In addition, the
parameter $\alpha$ also has slight impacts on the spectra. A joint sample,
including CMB data from Planck 2013 and WMAP9, galaxy clustering data from
WiggleZ and BOSS DR11, and JLA compilation of Type Ia supernova observations, is
adopted to confine the parameters. Within the context of the $\phi$CDM model
under consideration, the joint sample determines the cosmological parameters to
high precision. It turns out that $\alpha <4.995$ at 95% CL for the $\phi$CDM
model. And yet, the $\Lambda$CDM scenario corresponding to $\alpha = 0$ is not
ruled out at 95% CL. Moreover, we get $\Sigma m_{\nu}< 0.262$ eV at 95% CL for
the $\phi$CDM model, while the corresponding one for the $\Lambda$CDM model is
$\Sigma m_{\nu} < 0.293$ eV. The allowed scale of $\Sigma m_\nu$ in the
$\phi$CDM model is a bit smaller than that in the $\Lambda$CDM model. It is
consistent with the qualitative analysis, which reveals that the increases of
$\alpha$ and $\Sigma m_\nu$ both can result in the suppression of the matter
power spectrum. As a consequence, when $\alpha$ is larger, in order to avoid
suppressing the matter power spectrum too much, the value of $\Sigma m_\nu$
should be smaller.},

complicated process of structure formation in cosmology. This process is mainly
governed by gravity, which is the dominant force on large scales. To date, a
century after the formulation of general relativity, numerical codes for
structure formation still employ Newton's law of gravitation. This approximation
relies on the two assumptions that gravitational fields are weak and that they
are only sourced by non-relativistic matter. While the former appears well
justified on cosmological scales, the latter imposes restrictions on the nature
of the "dark" components of the Universe (dark matter and dark energy) which
are, however, poorly understood. Here we present the first simulations of cosmic
structure formation using equations consistently derived from general
relativity. We study in detail the small relativistic effects for a standard
{\Lambda}CDM cosmology which cannot be obtained within a purely Newtonian
framework. Our particle-mesh N-body code computes all six degrees of freedom of
the metric and consistently solves the geodesic equation for particles, taking
into account the relativistic potentials and the frame-dragging force. This
conceptually clean approach is very general and can be applied to various
settings where the Newtonian approximation fails or becomes inaccurate, ranging
from simulations of models with dynamical dark energy or warm/hot dark matter to

HLQG anomaly. There are different physical phenomena by which the HLQG could
have produced the observed temperature anomaly, such as for example the Sunyaev

The goal of this paper it is not to explain the observed alignment in terms of
these effects, but to show the shape and position of the HLQG anomaly, and
estimate its statistical significance, i.e. the probability that it could be
just the result of primordial Gaussian fluctuations. We analyze the CMB Planck
satellite temperature map of the region of sky corresponding to the angular
position of the HLQG, and compute an inner and an outer temperature by averaging
the CMB map over respectively the region subtended by the HLQG on the sky, and
over a region surrounding it. It turns out that the inner region is warmer than
the outer one, with a measured temperature difference of $\Delta T^{obs} \approx
43\mu K$. The temperature excess is then compared with the results of Montecarlo
simulations of random Gaussian realizations of the CMB map, indicating with at
least a $2.3\sigma$ confidence level, that the measured $\Delta T^{obs}$ cannot
be attributed to primordial Gaussian fluctuations. Its alignment with HLQG and

tidal interactions, provide a potentially significant contaminant to
measurements of cosmic shear. However, these intrinsic alignments are still
poorly understood for galaxies at the redshifts typically used in cosmic shear
analyses. For spiral galaxies, it is thought that tidal torquing is significant
in determining alignments resulting in zero correlation between the intrinsic
ellipticity and the gravitational potential in linear theory. Here, we calculate
the leading-order correction to this result in the tidal-torque model from non-
linear evolution, using second-order perturbation theory, and relate this to the
contamination from intrinsic alignments to the recently-measured cross-
correlation between galaxy ellipticities and the CMB lensing potential. On the
scales relevant for CMB lensing observations, the squeezed limit of the
gravitational bispectrum dominates the correlation. Physically, the large-scale
mode that sources CMB lensing modulates the small-scale power and hence the
intrinsic ellipticity, due to non-linear evolution. We find that the angular
cross-correlation from tidal torquing has a very similar scale dependence as in
the linear alignment model, believed to be appropriate for elliptical galaxies.
The amplitude of the cross-correlation is predicted to depend strongly on the
formation redshift, being smaller for galaxies that formed at higher redshift
when the bispectrum of the gravitational potential was smaller. Finally, we make
simple forecasts for constraints on intrinsic alignments from the correlation of
forthcoming cosmic shear measurements with current CMB lensing measurements. We
note that cosmic variance can be significantly reduced in measurements of the
difference in the intrinsic alignments for elliptical and spiral galaxies if
these can be separated (e.g., using colour).},

Furthermore, a first tomographic analysis of the cross-correlation signal is

(also referred to as the Sandage-Loeb test) can also directly measure $H(z)$ at
higher redshifts, covering the range of $z\in [2,5]$. We thus discuss what role
the redshift-drift observations can play in constraining dark energy with the

exploited the high-level of similarity of the emission measure in the cluster

assuming that the emission measure profiles at different redshift are weakly
self-similar, that is their shape is universal, explicitly allowing for
temperature and redshift dependence of the gas fraction. This cosmological test,

adding priors on the gas fraction evolution from hydrodynamic simulations.
Current data favour the cosmological constant with $w\equiv-1$, with no evidence

for simple modifications to the nonlinear evolution of the gravitational
potential $\psi$ that lead on large scales to the correct, fully relativistic
description of density perturbations in the Newtonian gauge. We note that the
relativistic constraint equation for $\psi$ can be cast as a diffusion equation,
with a diffusion length scale determined by the expansion of the Universe.
Exploiting the weak time evolution of $\psi$ in all regimes of interest, this
equation can be further accurately approximated as a Helmholtz equation, with an
effective relativistic 'screening' scale $\ell$ related to the Hubble radius. We
demonstrate that it is thus possible to carry out N-body simulations in the
Newtonian gauge by replacing Poisson's equation with this Helmholtz equation,
involving a trivial change in the Green's function kernel. Our results also
motivate a simple, approximate (but very accurate) gauge transformation -
$\delta_{\rm N}(\mathbf{k}) \approx \delta_{\rm sim}(\mathbf{k})\times
(k^2+\ell^{-2})/k^2$ - to convert the density field $\delta_{\rm sim}$ of
standard collisionless N-body simulations (initialised in the comoving
synchronous gauge) into the Newtonian gauge density $\delta_{\rm N}$ at
arbitrary times. A similar conversion can also be written in terms of particle
positions. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a Jeans stability
criterion induced by the expansion of the Universe. The appearance of the
screening scale $\ell$ in the evolution of $\psi$, in particular, leads to a
natural resolution of the 'Jeans swindle' in the presence of super-horizon
modes.},

tracing voids over cosmic time. The method is based on tracking watershed basins
(contiguous regions around density minima) of well developed voids at low
redshift, on a regular grid of density field. It enables us to construct a
robust and continuous mapping between voids at different redshifts, from initial
conditions to the present time. We discuss how the new approach eliminates
strong spurious effects of numerical origin when voids evolution is traced by
matching voids between successive snapshots (by analogy to halo merger trees).
We apply the new method to a cosmological simulation of a standard LambdaCDM
cosmological model and study evolution of basic properties of typical voids
(with effective radii between 6Mpc/h and 20Mpc/h at redshift z=0) such as
volumes, shapes, matter density distributions and relative alignments. The final
voids at low redshifts appear to retain a significant part of the configuration
acquired in initial conditions. Shapes of voids evolve in a collective way which
barely modifies the overall distribution of the axial ratios. The evolution
appears to have a weak impact on mutual alignments of voids implying that the
present state is in large part set up by the primordial density field. We
present evolution of dark matter density profiles computed on iso-density
surfaces which comply with the actual shapes of voids. Unlike spherical density
profiles, this approach enables us to demonstrate development of theoretically
predicted bucket-like shape of the final density profiles indicating a wide flat
core and a sharp transition to high-density void walls.},

of galaxies and other LSS tracers, but investigation into how survey systematics

maps, we study the impact of galaxy survey properties and systematic errors on
the accuracy of reconstructed ISW signal. We find that systematics that affect
the observed distribution of galaxies along the line of sight, such as photo-z
and bias-evolution related errors, have a relatively minor impact on
reconstruction quality. In contrast, however, we find that direction-dependent
calibration errors can be very harmful. Specifically, we find that in order to
avoid significant degradation of our reconstruction quality statistics,
direction-dependent number density fluctuations due to systematics must be
controlled so that their variance is smaller than $10^{-6}$ (which corresponds
to a 0.1% calibration). Additionally, we explore the implications of our results
for attempts to use reconstructed ISW maps to shed light on the origin of large-
angle CMB alignments. We find that there is only a weak correlation between the
true and reconstructed angular momentum dispersion, which quantifies alignment,
even for reconstructed ISW maps which are fairly accurate overall.},

averages out to a smooth Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The
root of the problem is that averaging does not commute with the Einstein
equations that govern the dynamics of the model. This leads to the well-know
question of backreaction in cosmology. In this work, we approach the problem
using the covariant framework of Macroscopic Gravity (MG). We use its
cosmological solution with a flat FLRW macroscopic background where the result
of averaging cosmic inhomogeneities has been encapsulated into a backreaction
density parameter denoted $\Omega_\mathcal{A}$. We constrain this averaged
universe using available cosmological data sets of expansion and growth
including, for the first time, a full CMB analysis from Planck temperature
anisotropy and polarization data, the supernovae data from Union 2.1, the galaxy
power spectrum from WiggleZ, the weak lensing tomography shear-shear cross
correlations from the CFHTLenS survey and the baryonic acoustic oscillation data
from 6Df, SDSS DR7 and BOSS DR9. We find that $-0.0155 \le \Omega_\mathcal{A}

As with 21cm data, the forest has the advantage of spectral information,
potentially yielding many lensed "slices" at different redshifts. We perform an
illustrative idealized test, generating a high resolution angular grid of
quasars (of order arcminute separation), and lensing the Lyman-alphaforest
spectra at redshifts z=2-3 using a foreground density field. We find that
standard quadratic estimators can be used to reconstruct images of the
foreground mass distribution at z~1. There currently exists a wealth of Lya
forest data from quasar and galaxy spectral surveys, with smaller sightline
separations expected in the future. Lyman-alpha forest lensing is sensitive to
the foreground mass distribution at redshifts intermediate between CMB lensing

between multiple images of lensed quasars. This method has already been applied,
obtaining a value of H_0 compatible with that obtained from the SNe 1A, but non
compatible with that obtained studying the anisotropies of the CMB. This
difference could be a statistical fluctuation or an indication of new physics
beyond the Standard Model of Cosmology, so it desirable to improve the precision
of the measurements. At the current technological capabilities it is possible to
obtain H_0 to a percent level uncertainty, so a more accurate theoretical model
could be necessary in order to increase the precision about the determination of
H_0. The actual formula which relates Delta t with H_0 is approximated; in this
paper we expose a proposal to go beyond the previous analysis and, within the
context of a new model, we obtain a more precise formula than that present in
the Literature.},

most important empirical challenges in modern cosmology: if they are found and
quantified with the mass spectrum expected, then this would close the door on a
vast array of competing theories. But in order for observational programs of
this kind to reach fruition, we need robust predictions. Here we explore
substructure predictions for lensing using galaxy lens-like hosts at z=0.2 from
the Illustris simulations both in full hydrodynamics and dark matter only. We
quantify substructures more massive than ~ 10^9 M_sun, comparable to current
lensing detections derived from HST, Keck, and ALMA. The addition of full
hydrodynamics reduces the overall subhalo mass function by about a factor of
two. Even for the dark matter only runs, most (~ 85%) lines of sight through
projected cylinders of size close to an Einstein radius contain no substructures
larger than 10^9 M_sun. The fraction of empty sight lines rises to ~ 95% in full
physics simulations. This suggests we will likely need hundreds of strong
lensing systems suitable for substructure studies, as well as predictions that

poses a fine-tuning challenge to current models of galaxy formation. We propose
that this relation could arise from collisional interactions between baryons and
dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for modification of gravity or ad
hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy the following
three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is comparable to the
dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy with baryons due to
elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM cross section and
the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely proportional to the DM
number density. We present an example of a particle physics model that gives a
DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and velocity dependence. Direct
detection constraints require our DM particles to be either very light ($m <<
m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding respectively to heating and
cooling of DM by baryons. In both cases, our mechanism applies and an
equilibrium configuration can in principle be reached. Here, we focus on the
heavy DM/cooling case as it is technically simpler. Under these assumptions, we
find that rotationally-supported disk galaxies could naturally settle to
equilibrium configurations satisfying a MDAR at all radii without invoking
finely tuned feedback processes. We also discuss issues related to the small
scale clumpiness of baryons, as well as predictions for pressure-supported
systems. We argue in particular that galaxy clusters do not follow the MDAR
despite being DM-dominated because they have not reached their equilibrium
configuration. Finally, we revisit existing phenomenological, astrophysical and
cosmological constraints on baryon-DM interactions in light of the unusual
density dependence of the cross section.},

An exception to this is when our Universe is highly ionized, since the source

from typical 21cm experiments, the classification accuracy depends strongly on
the effectiveness of foreground removal. Our results show that if foregrounds

baryonic effects lead to overall increases in both gravitational redshifts and
the transverse relativistic Doppler effects by up to ~50% for group size halos.

halo clustering strength at fixed halo mass $-$ an effect known as assembly bias
$-$ and are also strongly affected by the local, non-linear cosmic web.
Characterising a halo's local web environment by its tidal anisotropy $\alpha$
at scales $\sim4$ x the halo radius, we demonstrate that these multi-scale
correlations represent two distinct statistical links: one between the internal
property and $\alpha$, and the other between $\alpha$ and large-scale (
$>30h^{-1}$Mpc) halo bias $b_1$. We focus on scalar internal properties of
haloes related to formation time (concentration $c_{\rm vir}$), shape (mass
ellipsoid asphericity $c/a$), velocity dispersion structure (velocity ellipsoid
asphericity $c_v/a_v$ and velocity anisotropy $\beta$) and angular momentum
(dimensionless spin $\lambda$) in the mass range $8\times10^{11}< M_{\rm
vir}/(h^{-1}M_\odot)<5\times10^{14}$. Using conditional correlation coefficients
and other detailed tests, we show that the joint distribution of $\alpha$, $b_1$
and any of the internal properties $c\in\{\beta,c_v/a_v,c/a,c_{\rm
vir},\lambda\}$ is consistent with $p(\alpha,b_1,c)\simeq
p(\alpha)p(b_1|\alpha)p(c|\alpha)$, at all but the largest masses.
$\textit{Thus, the assembly bias trends $c-b_1$ reflect the two fundamental
correlations $c-\alpha$ and $b_1-\alpha$.}$ Our results are unaffected by the
exclusion of haloes with recent major merger events or splashback objects,
although the latter are distinguished by the fact that $\alpha$ does not explain
their assembly bias trends. The overarching importance of $\alpha$ provides a
new perspective on the nature of assembly bias of distinct haloes, with
potential ramifications for incorporating realistic assembly bias effects into
mock catalogs of future large-scale structure surveys and for detecting galaxy
assembly bias.},

had filled the intergalactic medium (IGM) since recombination (z~1000). The
evolution of this process constrains key properties of these earliest luminous
sources, thus observationally constraining reionization is a key science goal
for the next decade. The measurement of Lyman-alpha emission from
photometrically-identified galaxies is a highly constraining probe of
reionization, as a neutral IGM will resonantly scatter these photons, reducing
detectability. While significant work has been done with 8-10m telescopes, these
observations require extremely large telescopes (ELTs); the flux limits
available from today's 10m class telescopes are sufficient for only the
brightest known galaxies (m < 26). Ultra-deep surveys with the Giant Magellan
Telescope (GMT) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will be capable of detecting
Lyman-alpha emission from galaxies 2-3 magnitudes fainter than today's deepest
surveys. Wide-field fiber spectroscopy on the GMT combined with narrow-field AO-
assisted slit spectroscopy on the TMT will be able to probe the expected size of
ionized bubbles throughout the epoch of reionization, following up degree scale
deep imaging surveys with the Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope. These data

optical polarization produces both (a) a selection bias in favor of galaxies

build toy models to obtain for the first time an estimate for the impact of
polarization on PSF shapes and the impact of the selection bias due to the
polarization effect on the measurement of the ellipticity used in shear
measurements. In particular, we are interested in determining if this effect
will be significant for WFIRST. We show that the systematic uncertainties in the
ellipticity components are $8\times 10^{-5}$ and $1.1 \times 10^{-4}$ due to the
selection bias and PSF errors respectively. Compared to the overall requirements
on knowledge of the WFIRST PSF ellipticity ($4.7\times 10^{-4}$ per component),
both of these systematic uncertainties are sufficiently close to the WFIRST
tolerance level that more detailed studies of the polarization effects or more
stringent requirements on polarization-sensitive instrumentation for WFIRST are

transmission spikes, both with optically thin simulations of the post-
reionization Universe using a homogeneous UV background and full radiative
transfer simulations of a late reionization model. We find that the width of the
fitted components of the simulated transmission spikes is very sensitive to the
instantaneous temperature of the reionized IGM. The internal structures of the
spikes are more prominant in low temeperature models of the IGM. The width
distribution of the observed transmission spikes, which require high spectral
resolution ($\leq $ 8 km/s) to be resolved, is reproduced for optically thin
simulations with a temperature at mean density of $T_0= (11000 \pm 1600,10500\pm

slope of the temperature-density relation, which is favoured to be moderately
steeper than isothermal. In the inhomogeneous, late reionization, full radiative
transfer simulations where islands of neutral hydrogen persist to $z\sim5.3$,

energy density needs to rapidly redshift away, we explore decays to massless
fields around the era of matter-radiation equality. We highlight a concrete
implementation of ultralight pseudo-scalars, axions, that decay to an abelian
dark sector. This scenario circumvents major problems of other popular
realizations of early universe scalar models in that it uses a regular scalar
potential that is quadratic around the minimum, instead of the extreme fine-
tuning of many existing models. The idea is that the scalar is initially frozen
in its potential until $H\sim m$, then efficient energy transfer from the scalar
to the massless field can occur shortly after the beginning of oscillations due
to resonance. We introduce an effective fluid model which captures the
transition from the frozen scalar phase to the radiation dark sector phase. We
perform a fit to a combined Planck 2018, BAO, SH$_0$ES and Pantheon supernovae
dataset and find that the model gives $H_0=69.9_{-0.86}^{+0.84}$ km/s/Mpc with
$\Delta\chi^2 \approx -9$ compared to $\Lambda$CDM; while inclusions of other
data sets may worsen the fit. Importantly, we find that large values of the
coupling between fields is required for sufficiently rapid decay: For axion-
gauge field models $\phi F\tilde{F}/\Lambda$ it requires $\Lambda\lesssim f/80$,
where $2\pi f$ is the field range. We find related conclusions for scalar-scalar
models $\sim\phi\,\chi^2$ and for models that utilize perturbative decays. We
conclude that these sorts of ultralight scalar models that purport to alleviate
the Hubble tension, while being reasonable effective field theories, require
features that are difficult to embed within UV physics.},

while realizing a high value of $H_0$ suggested by local measurements. As a
concrete example for a successful scenario with early recombination, we
demonstrate that a model with time-varying $m_e$ can indeed satisfy all the
conditions. We further show that such a model can also be well fitted to low-$z$
distance measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and type-Ia
supernovae (SNeIa) with a simple extension of the model. Time-varying $m_e$ in
the framework of $\Omega_k\Lambda$CDM is found to be a sufficient and excellent
example as a solution to the $H_0$ tension, yielding $H_0=72.3_{-2.8}
^{+2.7}\,$km/sec/Mpc from the combination of CMB, BAO and SNeIa data even
without incorporating any direct local $H_0$ measurements. Apart from the $H_0$
tension, this model is also favored from the viewpoint of the CMB lensing

unique beam-weighted foreground. By generating eigenvectors to fit each

the eigenvectors for modelling an achromatic, isotropic beam -- the ideal case
-- are nearly identical regardless of the unweighted foreground model used, and
are practicably indistinguishable from polynomial-based models. When
anisotropic, chromatic beams weight the foreground, however, a coupling is
introduced between the spatial and spectral structure of the foreground which
distorts the eigenvectors away from the polynomial models and induces a
dependence of the basis upon the exact features of the beam (chromaticity,
pattern, pointing) and foreground (spectral index, sky brightness temperature
map). We find that the beam has a greater impact upon the eigenvectors than
foreground models. Any model which does not account for its distortion may
produce RMS uncertainties on the order of $\sim 10$ - $10^3$ Kelvin for six-
parameter, single spectrum fits. If the beam is incorporated directly using SVD
and training sets, however, the resultant eigenvectors yield milli-Kelvin level
uncertainties. Given a sufficiently detailed description of the sky, our

excluding the $l<30$ temperature and polarization likelihoods; $iii)$ imposing
early universe priors, that disentangle early and late time physics. Through a
joint analysis with low-redshift supernovae type-Ia and gravitationally lensed

Oscillation (BAO) data}, we find that the inclusion of early universe CMB priors
is consistent with the local estimate of $H_0$ while excluding the low-$l$+lowE
likelihoods mildly relaxes the tension. This is in contrast to joint analyses
with the complete CMB data. Our simple implementation of contrasting the effect
of different CMB priors on the $H_0$ estimate shows that the early universe
information from the CMB data when decoupled from late-times physics could be in
agreement with a higher value of $H_0$. {We also find no evidence for the early
dark energy model using only the early universe physics within the CMB data.
Finally using the BAO data in different redshift ranges to perform inverse
distance ladder analysis, we find that the early universe modifications, while
being perfectly capable of alleviating the $H_0$-tension when including the BAO
galaxy clustering data, would be at odds with the Ly-$\alpha$ BAO data due to
the difference in $r_{\rm d}\, vs.\, H_0$ correlation between the two BAO

late-time physics within the CMB analysis. This in turn recasts the
$H_0$-tension as an effect of late-time physics in CMB, instead of the current

Current methods all rely on measurements of galaxy peculiar velocities (through

inferred, assuming that dark matter follows geodesics. If this is not the case,
all the proposed tests fail to measure the anisotropic stress. In this letter,
we propose a novel test which directly measures anisotropic stress, without
relying on any assumption about the unknown dark matter. Our method uses
relativistic effects in the galaxy number counts to provide a direct measurement
of the time component of the metric. By comparing this with lensing observations
our test provides a direct measurement of the anisotropic stress.},

broad redshift range, large sky coverage, and detectability of fainter galaxies.
In this work, we explore the possible synergy of the LVK with the spectroscopic
galaxy surveys such as \texttt{DESI} and \texttt{SPHEREx} to measure the
cosmological parameters which are related to the cosmic expansion history and
the GW bias parameters. We show that by using the three-dimensional spatial
cross-correlation between the dark GW sources and the spectroscopic galaxy
samples, we can measure the value of Hubble constant with about $2\%$ and
$1.5\%$ precision from \texttt{LVK+DESI} and \texttt{LVK+SPHEREx} respectively
within the five years of observation time with $50\%$ duty-cycle. Similarly, the
dark energy equation of state can be measured with about $10\%$ and $8\%$
precision from \texttt{LVK+DESI} and \texttt{LVK+SPHEREx} respectively. We find
that due to the large sky coverage of \texttt{SPHEREx} than \texttt{DESI},
performance in constraining the cosmological parameters is better from the
former than the latter. By combining \texttt{Euclid} along with \texttt{DESI}
and \texttt{SPHEREx}, a marginal gain in the measurability of the cosmological
parameters is possible from the sources at high redshift ($z\geq 0.9$).},

improvements have made tensions emerge between low- and high-redshift
observables, most importantly in determinations of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and
the (rescaled) clustering amplitude $S_8$. The high-redshift data, from the
cosmic microwave background (CMB), crucially relies on recombination physics for
its interpretation. Here we study how small-scale baryon inhomogeneities (i.e.,
clumping) can affect recombination and consider whether they can relieve both
the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Such small-scale clumping, which may be caused by
primordial magnetic fields or baryon isocurvature below kpc scales, enhances the
recombination rate even when averaged over larger scales, shifting recombination
to earlier times. We introduce a flexible clumping model, parametrized via three
spatial zones with free densities and volume fractions, and use it to study the
impact of clumping on CMB observables. We find that increasing $H_0$ decreases
both $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$, which alleviates the $S_8$ tension. On the other
hand, the shift in $\Omega_m$ is disfavored by the low-$z$ baryon-acoustic-
oscillations measurements. We find that the clumping parameters that can change
the CMB sound horizon enough to explain the $H_0$ tension also alter the damping
tail, so they are disfavored by current Planck 2018 data. We test how the CMB
damping-tail information rules out changes to recombination by first removing
$\ell>1000$ multipoles in Planck data, where we find that clumping could resolve
the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we make predictions for future CMB experiments,
as their improved damping-tail precision can better constrain departures from
standard recombination. Both the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 will provide
decisive evidence for or against clumping as a resolution to the $H_0$ tension.},

the difference between the locally measured Hubble constant $H_0$ and the value
inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Interacting radiation has
been suggested as a solution, but studies show that conventional models are
precluded by high-$\ell$ CMB polarization data. It seems at least plausible that
a solution may be provided by related models that distinguish between high- and
low-$\ell$ multipoles. When interactions of strongly-coupled radiation are
mediated by a force-carrier that becomes non-relativistic, the dark radiation
undergoes a "step" in which its relative energy density increases as the
mediator deposits its entropy into the lighter species. If this transition
occurs while CMB-observable modes are inside the horizon, high- and low-$\ell$
peaks are impacted differently, corresponding to modes that enter the horizon
before or after the step. These dynamics are naturally packaged into the
simplest supersymmetric theory, the Wess-Zumino model, with the mass of the
scalar mediator near the eV-scale. We investigate the cosmological signatures of
such "Wess-Zumino Dark Radiation" (WZDR) and find that it provides an improved
fit to the CMB alone, favoring larger values of $H_0$. If supernovae
measurements from the SH0ES collaboration are also included in the analysis, the
inferred value of $H_0$ is yet larger, but the preference for dark radiation and
the location of the transition is left nearly unchanged. Utilizing a
standardized set of measures, we compare to other models and find that WZDR is
among the most successful at addressing the $H_0$ tension and the best of those

HIRAX achieves sub-percent precision on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters, with SKAO

  abstract = {21 cm intensity mapping (IM) has the potential to be a strong and unique probe
of cosmology from redshift of order unity to redshift potentially as high as 30.
For post-reionization 21 cm observations, the signal is modulated by the thermal
and dynamical reaction of gas in the galaxies to the passage of ionization
fronts during the Epoch of Reionization. In this work, we investigate the impact
of inhomogeneous reionization on the post-reionization 21 cm power spectrum and
the induced shifts of cosmological parameters at redshifts $3.5 \lesssim z
\lesssim 5.5$. We make use of hydrodynamics simulations that could resolve
small-scale baryonic structure evolution to quantify HI abundance fluctuation,
while semi-numerical large box 21cmFAST simulations capable of displaying
inhomogeneous reionization process are deployed to track the inhomogeneous
evolution of reionization bubbles. We discussed the prospects of capturing this
effect in two post-reionization 21 cm intensity mapping experiments: SKA1-LOW
and PUMA. We find the inhomogeneous reionization effect could impact the HI
power spectrum up to tens of percent level and shift cosmological parameters
estimation from sub-percent to tens percent in the observation of future post-
reionization 21 cm intensity mapping experiments such as PUMA, while SKA1-LOW is
likely to miss this effect at the redshifts of interest given the considered
configuration. In particular, the shift is up to 0.0206 in the spectral index
$n_s$ and 0.0192 eV in the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$ depending on
the reionization model and the observational parameters. We discuss strategies
to mitigate and separate these biases.},

conveniently parametrized by $\alpha$, the constant logarithmic linear growth
rate of fluctuations (with $\alpha=1$ in the usual case). For $-3< n<-1$, where
the one-loop PS is both infrared and ultraviolet convergent and thus explicitly
self-similar, it is characterized conveniently by a single numerical coefficient
$c(n, \alpha)$. We compare the analytical predictions for $c(n=-2, \alpha)$ with
results from a suite of $N$-body simulations with $\alpha \in [0.25, 1]$
performed with an appropriately modified version of the GADGET code. Although
the simulations are of small ($256^3$) boxes, the constraint of self-similarity
allows the identification of the converged PS at a level of accuracy sufficient
to test the analytical predictions for the $\alpha$ dependence of the evolved
PS. Good agreement for the predicted dependence on $\alpha$ of the PS is found.
To treat the UV sensitivity of results which grows as one approaches $n =-1$, we
derive exact results incorporating a regularization $k_c$ and obtain expressions
for $c(n, \alpha, k_c/k)$. Assuming that this regularization is compatible with
self-similarity allows us to infer a predicted functional form of the PS
equivalent to that derived in effective field theory (EFT). The coefficient of
the leading EFT correction at one loop has a strong dependence on $\alpha$, with
a change in sign at $\alpha \approx 0.16$, providing a potentially stringent
test of EFT.},

incorporate dark matter self-interactions. The simulation results show that the
observed spatial offsets between the different mass components are well
reproduced in self-interacting dark matter models with an elastic cross-section
in the range \sigma_DM/m_X ~ 4 -5 cm^2/gr. In addition, the mean relative line-
of-sight radial velocity between the two brightest cluster galaxies is found to
be on the order of several hundred km/s. We argue that these findings provide an
unambiguous signature of a dark matter behavior that exhibits collisional
properties in a very energetic high-redshift cluster collision. The range of
allowed values we find for sigma_DM/m_X is, however, inconsistent with present
upper limits. To resolve this tension we suggest the possibility that the self-
interacting dark matter model used here be considered as only a low order
approximation, and that the underlying physical processes that describe the
interaction of dark matter in major cluster mergers are more complex than can be
adequately represented by the commonly assumed approach based on the scattering
of dark matter particles.},

which can emit radiation through its 21 cm hyperfine transition. This 21 cm

Measuring the 21 cm power spectrum is a key science goal for the future Square
Kilometre Array (SKA), however, observing and interpreting it is a challenging
task. Another high-potential probe of the EoR is the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-
Zel'dovich effect (pkSZ), observed as a foreground to the primary cosmic
microwave background temperature anisotropies on small scales. Despite recent
promising measurements by ground-based telescopes, placing constraints on
reionization from pkSZ observations is a non-trivial task, subject to strong
model dependence.   In this work, we propose to alleviate the difficulties in
observing and interpreting the 21 cm and pkSZ power spectra by combining them.
With a simple yet effective parametric model that establishes a formal
connection between them, we are able to jointly fit mock 21 cm and pkSZ data
points. We confirm that these two observables provide complementary information
on reionization, leading to significantly improved constraints when combined. We
demonstrate that with as few as two measurements of the 21 cm power spectrum
with 100 hours of observations with the SKA, as well as a single $\ell=3000$
pkSZ data point, we can reconstruct the reionization history of the Universe and
its morphology. We find that the reionization global history (morphology) is
better constrained with two 21 cm measurements at different redshifts (scales).
Therefore, a combined analysis of the two probes will give access to tighter
constraints on cosmic reionization even in the early stages of 21 cm detections.},

dispersion as a function of redshift, galaxy type, feedback model and how these

dispersion varies dramatically between different implementations of baryonic
feedback, allowing FRBs with host identification to be a valuable probe of
feedback physics and thus provide necessary priors for upcoming analysis of the
statistical properties of the large-scale structure.   We further find that any
dependency on the exact location of events within the halo is small. While there
exists an evolution of the dispersion measure with redshift and halo mass, it is
largely driven by varying star formation rates of the halo. Spectral information
from FRB hosts can therefore be used to put priors on the host galaxy dispersion

  abstract = {In recent years, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and PTA
collaborations have raised the intriguing possibility of excess matter power at
small scales. Such an increase can be achieved by ultra slow roll (USR) phase
during inflationary epoch. We constrain excess power over small scales within
the framework of such models using cosmological datasets, particularly of CMB
anisotropies and Lyman-$\alpha$. We parameterize the USR phase in terms of the
e-fold at the onset of USR (counted from the end of inflation) $\bar N_1$ and
the duration of USR phase $\Delta N$. The former dictates the scale of
enhancement in the primordial power spectrum, while the latter determines the
amplitude of such an enhancement. From a joint dataset of CMB, SNIa and galaxy
surveys, we obtain $\bar N_1 \lesssim 45$ with no bound on $\Delta N$. This in
turn implies that the scales over which the power spectrum can deviate
significantly from the nearly scale invariant behavior of a typical slow-roll
model is $k \gtrsim 1 \, \rm Mpc^{-1}$. On the other hand, the Lyman-$\alpha$
data is sensitive to baryonic power spectrum along the line of sight. We
consider a semi-analytic theoretical method and high spectral-resolution
Lyman-$\alpha$ data to constrain the model. The Lyman-$\alpha$ data limits both
the USR parameters: $\bar N_1 \lesssim 41$ and $\Delta N \lesssim 0.4$. This
constrains the amplitude of the power spectrum enhancement to be less than a
factor of hundred over scales $1 \lesssim k/{\rm Mpc^{-1}} \lesssim 100$,
thereby considerably improving the constraint on power over these scales as
compared to the bounds arrived at from CMB spectral distortion.},

Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) and cosmological constant plus torsion (named
Case II) models perform best by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), but the
$\Lambda$CDM is the best cosmological model preferred by Bayesian Information

Dark Energy and cosmological torsion models may alleviate the Hubble tension,
the reported value of the Hubble constant obtained from QSO+BAO datasets

scale-dependent features at different stages of reionization using numerical
simulations and build a source model-independent framework to probe the
properties of the intergalactic medium using EoR 21-cm signal power spectrum
measurements. Under the assumption of high spin temperature, we modelled the
redshift evolution of the ratio of EoR 21-cm brightness temperature power
spectrum and the corresponding density power spectrum using an ansatz consisting
of a set of redshift and scale-independent parameters. This set of eight
parameters probes the redshift evolution of the average ionization fraction and
the quantities related to the morphology of the ionized regions. We have tested
this ansatz on different reionization scenarios generated using different
simulation algorithms and found that it is able to recover the redshift
evolution of the average neutral fraction within an absolute deviation $\lesssim
0.1$. Our framework allows us to interpret 21-cm signal power spectra in terms
of parameters related to the state of the IGM. This source model-independent
framework can efficiently constrain reionization scenarios using multi-redshift

use the recently released DESI Year 1 BAO data combined with the CMB acoustic

can be fully explained within EDE via either moderately increased star formation
efficiencies ($\epsilon_{\ast}\sim 3-10\%$ at $M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm

$M_{\rm halo}\sim 10^{10.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) that are within the scatter of
hydrodynamical simulation predictions. A similar agreement is difficult to
achieve in $\Lambda$CDM, especially at $z\gtrsim 14$, where the required
$\sigma_{\rm UV}$ exceeds the maximum value seen in simulations. Furthermore,
the implausibly large cosmic stellar mass densities inferred from some JWST
observations are no longer in tension with cosmology when the EDE is considered.
Our findings highlight EDE as an intriguing unified solution to a fundamental
problem in cosmology and the recent tensions raised by JWST observations. Data

set to be a free parameter at a given redshift to fit the VNC data and explore
its redshift evolution. We find that, the VNC can correctly derive the

because that, since the VNC is not sensitive to void shape, the modified

strong correlation, independent of the subgrid model and cosmology, with
quantities known to encapsulate baryonic impacts on the matter power spectrum,
such as baryon spread and the halo baryon fraction. We propose an innovative

underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-

redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by
Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
observables in their best-fitting void models and in the homogeneous $Planck$
cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO
measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity
of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance
$D_{\mathrm{V}}$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the homogeneous
model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy
appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent
uncertainties, the 42 considered $D_{\mathrm{V}}$ observations give a total
$\chi^2$ of 75.7 for the void-free model, while the void models give only $47.3
- 51.2$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall
tension from $3.3\sigma$ without a void to $1.1\sigma - 1.4\sigma$ in the void
models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of
the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth. The void-free model provides the
worst fit in almost every case. Overall, our results suggest that recent
evidence of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous
$Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by
considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.},

components are hard to measure. Here, we present the first observations of a
novel effect of transverse velocities: the dipole signatures that they imprint
on the Cosmic Microwave Background. The peculiar velocity field points towards
gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a large-scale
dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of Mpc. Analogous
dipoles will also exist in all other fields that correlate with the potential.
These dipoles are readily observed in projection on the CMB sky via
gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect -- both of
which correlate with transverse peculiar velocities. The large-scale ISW dipole
is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the
opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for analysing these velocity-
related dipoles and demonstrate how stacking can extract the signal from sky
maps of galaxy properties, CMB temperature, and lensing. We show that the CMB
dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the usual
direction-averaged correlation function, so this new observable provides
additional cosmological information. We present the first detections of the
dipole signal in (i) galaxy density; (ii) CMB lensing convergence; and (iii) CMB
temperature -- interpreted as the ISW effect -- using galaxies from the SDSS-III
BOSS survey and CMB maps from Planck. We show that the observed signals are
consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions, and use the combined lensing and ISW
results to set limits on linearised models of modified gravity.},

of the quasar proximity effect, which accounts by construction for the fact that
quasars reside in overdense regions. We test this model on quasar Lyman-alpha

self-consistent formation of quasar black holes and the intergalactic medium
surrounding them. Fitting the model to individual quasar spectra, we constrain
two parameters, r_eq (the radius at which the local quasar radiation intensity
equals the background), and the quasar bias b_q (related to host halo mass). We
find that r_eq can be recovered in an unbiased fashion with a statistical
uncertainty of 25-50% from a single quasar spectrum. Applying such fitting to
samples of millions of spectra from e.g., DESI would allow measurement of the
UVBG intensity and its evolution with redshift with high precision. We use
another, larger-scale, lower resolution simulation (Uchuu) to test how such a

exemplify such a test by considering one specific effective theory that leads to
such gravitational parity-violation, Chern-Simons gravity. We show that the

description of GW in the theories of parity-violating gravity, we study the
effects of velocity and amplitude birefringence on the GW waveforms. Decomposing
the GWs into the circular polarization modes, the two birefringence effects
exactly correspond to the modifications in phase and amplitude of GW waveforms
respectively. We find that, for each circular polarization mode, the amplitude,
phase and velocity of GW can be modified by both the parity-violating terms and
parity-conserving terms in gravity. Therefore, in order to test the parity
symmetry in gravity, we should compare the difference between two circular
polarization modes, rather than measuring an individual mode. Combining two
circular modes, we obtain the GW waveforms in the Fourier domain, and obtain the
deviations from those in General Relativity. The GW waveforms derived in this
paper are also applicable to the theories of parity-conserving gravity, which
have the modified dispersion relations (e.g. massive gravity, double special
relativity theory, extra-dimensional theories, etc), or/and have the modified
friction terms (e.g. nonlocal gravity, gravitational theory with time-dependent
Planck mass, etc).},

signal in primordial scalar perturbations. Specifically, we find that, after dCS
amplifies one graviton helicity due to a tachyonic instability, the graviton-
mediated correlation between two pairs of scalars develops a parity-odd
component. This correlation, the primordial scalar trispectrum, is then
transferred to the corresponding curvature correlator and thus is imprinted in
both LSS and the CMB. We find that the parity-odd piece has roughly the same
amplitude as its parity-even counterpart, scaled linearly by the degree of
gravitational circular polarization $\Pi_{\rm circ} \sim
\sqrt{\varepsilon}[H^2/(M_{\rm Pl} f)] \leq 1$, with $\varepsilon$ the slow-roll
parameter, $H$ the inflationary Hubble scale, $f$ the dCS decay constant, and
the upper bound saturated for purely circularly-polarized gravitons. We also
find that, in the collapsed limit, the ratio of the two trispectra contains
direct information about the graviton's spin. In models beyond standard
inflationary dCS, e.g. those with multiple scalar fields or superluminal scalar
sound speed, there can be a large enhancement factor $F \gtrsim 10^6$ to the
trispectrum. We find that an LSS survey that contains $N_{\rm modes}$ linear
modes would place an $n\sigma$ constraint on $\Pi_{\rm circ}r$ of $\sim 0.04\
(n/3)(10^6/F)(10^6/N_{\rm modes})^{1/2}$ from the parity-odd galaxy trispectrum,
for tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We also forecast for several spectroscopic and
21-cm surveys. This constraint implies that, for high-scale single-field
inflation parameters, LSS can probe very large dCS decay constants $f \lesssim
4\times 10^9\ {\rm GeV}(3/n)(F/10^6)\left(N_{\rm modes}/10^6\right)^{1/2}$. Our
result is the first example of a massless particle yielding a parity-odd scalar

has been extensively tested with laboratory and astrophysical observations.
However, many quantum gravity models and theories beyond the Standard Model of
Particle Physics predict a violation of Lorentz invariance at energies close to
the Planck scale. This article reviews observational and experimental tests of
Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with photons, neutrinos and gravitational
waves. Most astrophysical tests of LIV using photons are based on searching for
a correlation of the spectral lag data with redshift and energy. These have been
primarily carried out using compact objects such as pulsars, Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN), and Gamma-ray bursts (GRB). There have also been some claims for
LIV from some of these spectral lag observations with GRBs, which however are in
conflict with the most stringent limits obtained from other LIV searches.
Searches have also been carried out using polarization measurements from GRBs
and AGNs. For neutrinos, tests have been made using both astrophysical
observations at MeV energies (from SN 1987A) as well as in the TeV-PeV energy
range based on IceCube observations, atmospheric neutrinos, and long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiments. Cosmological tests of LIV entail looking for a
constancy of the speed of light as a function of redshift using multiple
observational probes, as well as looking for birefringence in Cosmic Microwave
Background observations. This article will review all of these aforementioned
observational tests of LIV, including results which are in conflict with each
other.},

We make the first measurements of the parity-odd scalar CMB, focusing on the
large-scale ($2<\ell<510$) temperature anisotropies measured by Planck. This is
facilitated by new quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators for binned correlators,
which account for mask convolution and leakage between even- and odd-parity
components, and achieve ideal variances within $\approx 20\%$. We perform a
blind test for parity violation by comparing a $\chi^2$ statistic from Planck to
theoretical expectations, using two suites of simulations to account for the
possible likelihood non-Gaussianity and residual foregrounds. We find
consistency at the $\approx 0.4\sigma$ level, yielding no evidence for novel
early-Universe phenomena. The measured trispectra allow for a wealth of new
physics to be constrained; here, we use them to constrain eight primordial
models, including Ghost Inflation, Cosmological Collider scenarios, and Chern-
Simons gauge fields. We find no signatures of new physics, with a maximal
detection significance of $2.0\sigma$. Our results also indicate that the recent
parity excesses seen in the BOSS galaxy survey are not primordial in origin,
given that the CMB dataset contains roughly $250\times$ more primordial modes,

We find that a decrease of the sound speed of the pseudo-scalar field highly
suppresses the sourced scalar with respect to the sourced tensor modes, thus
effectively allowing for the production of a greater tensor signal. Contrary to
the case of a canonical axion inflaton, it is in this case possible for the
sourced tensor modes to dominate over the vacuum ones without violating the non-
Gaussianity constraints from the scalar sector, which results in a nearly
totally polarized tensor signal at CMB scales. We also study the extension of
this mechanisms to the multiple field case, in which the axion is not the

to decouple the bulk equations in the quasistatic approximation, which we argue
may be a better approximation at large scales than thought before. We then study
the nonlinearities in the bulk and brane equations, concentrating on the
workings of the Vainshtein mechanism by which the theory becomes general
relativity (GR) at small scales. We show that at the level of the power
spectrum, to a good approximation, the effect of nonlinearities in the modified
gravity sector may be absorbed into a renormalization of the gravitational
constant. Since the relation between the lensing potential and density
perturbations is entirely unaffected by the extra physics in these theories, the
modified gravity can be described in this approximation by a single function, an
effective gravitational constant for nonrelativistic motion that depends on
space and time. We develop a resummation scheme to calculate it, and provide
predictions for the nonlinear power spectrum. At the level of the large-scale
bispectrum, the leading order corrections are obtained by standard perturbation
theory techniques, and show that the suppression of the brane-bending mode leads
to characteristic signatures in the non-Gaussianity generated by gravity,
generic to models that become GR at small scales through second-derivative
interactions. We compare the predictions in this work to numerical simulations
in a companion paper.},

foundational aspects of the standard model of cosmology -- in particular, the
fact that dark energy is a direct consequence of the homogeneity assumption. We
discuss the foundations of the assumption of spatial homogeneity, in the case
when the Copernican Principle is adopted. We present results that show how
(almost-) homogeneity follows from (almost-) isotropy of various observables.
The analysis requires the fully nonlinear field equations -- i.e., it is not
possible to use second- or higher-order perturbation theory, since one cannot
assume a homogeneous and isotropic background. Then we consider what happens if
the Copernican Principle is abandoned in our Hubble volume. The simplest models
are inhomogeneous but spherically symmetric universes which do not require dark
energy to fit the distance modulus. Key problems in these models are to compute
the CMB anisotropies and the features of large-scale structure. We review how to
construct perturbation theory on a non-homogeneous cosmological background, and
discuss the complexities that arise in using this to determine the growth of
large-scale structure.},

  abstract = {A large bulk flow, which is in tension with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter
($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model, has been observed. In this paper, we provide
a physically plausible explanation of this bulk flow, based on the assumption
that some fraction of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background is
due to an intrinsic fluctuation, so that the subtraction of the observed dipole
leads to a mismatch between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) defined rest
frame and the matter rest frame. We investigate a model that takes into account
the relative velocity (hereafter the tilted velocity) between the two frames,
and develop a Bayesian statistic to explore the likelihood of this tilted
velocity.   By studying various independent peculiar velocity catalogs, we find
that: (1) the magnitude of the tilted velocity $u$ is around 400 km/s, and its
direction is close to what is found from previous bulk flow analyses; for most
catalogs analysed, u=0 is excluded at about the $2.5 \sigma$ level;(2)
constraints on the magnitude of the tilted velocity can result in constraints on
the duration of inflation, due to the fact that inflation can neither be too
long (no dipole effect) nor too short (very large dipole effect); (3) Under the
assumption of a super-horizon isocurvature fluctuation, the constraints on the
tilted velocity require that inflation lasts at least 6 e-folds longer (at the
95% confidence interval) than that required to solve the horizon problem. This
opens a new window for testing inflation and models of the early Universe from
observations of large scale structure.},

transfer between the different species is discussed in this novel framework and
a set of general conservation laws, connecting the vorticities of the three-

demonstrating that a source of large-scale vorticity resides in the spatial
gradients of the geometry and of the electromagnetic sources, the total
vorticity is estimated to lowest order in the spatial gradients and by enforcing
the validity of the momentum constraint. By acknowledging the current bounds on
the tensor to scalar ratio in the (minimal) tensor extension of the $\Lambda$CDM
paradigm the maximal comoving magnetic field induced by the total vorticity
turns out to be, at most, of the order of $10^{-37}$ G over the typical comoving
scales ranging between 1 and 10 Mpc. While the obtained results seem to be
irrelevant for seeding a reasonable galactic dynamo action, they demonstrate how
the proposed fully inhomogeneous treatment can be used for the systematic
scrutiny of pre-decoupling plasmas beyond the conventional perturbative

consider a cosmic string network, and discuss its detectability from upcoming

signal-to-noise ratios for the B-mode cosmic shear and curl-mode deflection

intercommuting probability of the string network, $P$, and they are potentially
detectable from the upcoming cosmic shear and CMB lensing observations. For
$P\sim 10^{-1}$, the minimum detectable tension of the cosmic string will be
down to $G\mu\sim 5\times 10^{-8}$. With a theoretically inferred smallest value

preference for isotropic cosmic birefringence, consistent with previous analyses

Instrument (DESI) DR2 results suggest that dark energy evolves over cosmic
history, pointing to new physics in the late-time universe. In this paper, we
propose that domain walls associated with the string axion can naturally explain
the isotropic cosmic birefringence, focusing on the case in which the axion
starts near a hilltop. Interestingly, to avoid the domain wall problem, these
walls must form well after recombination. The predicted rotation angle, $\beta
\approx 0.21\,c_\gamma$ degrees (with anomaly coefficient $c_\gamma \approx 1$),
is in excellent agreement with observations. This scenario can be further tested
by probing anisotropic birefringence of photons emitted long after
recombination, as well as gravitational waves. Moreover, starting the axion
oscillation from a hilltop naturally enhances its abundance via anharmonic
effects, thus contributing to the dark energy component. We discuss how this
hilltop axion scenario may connect with the DESI results.},

(CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the
gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point
function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to
gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing
trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed
discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-
lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the
PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in
lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of
the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak
constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various
ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future
datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will
be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the
ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-
resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on
primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be
large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.},
