also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross

for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in
$\tau_{\gamma\gamma}$ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in

measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect.},

vacuum dispersion of light, which leads to an additional time delay between
photons with different frequencies when they propagate through a fixed distance.
The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have
been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current
studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive
photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate
the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological
model based on the fundamental postulate of the masslessness of photons, here we
employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network
(ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-
chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs
and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of
$m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le
2.0 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 6.5 \times

provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino
flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for
realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our
limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-

electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption

cosmological model-independent (based on the luminosity distance data from 174
GRBs) to test the LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs
provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors
arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object
populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-

These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects

This paper focuses on the investigation of Lorentz violations with the context

study the sensitivities of Lorentz-violating coefficients for three distinct
types of clock redshift tests, including the traditional gravitational redshift
test, null-redshift test I and null-redshift test II. Each of these tests is
sensitivity to different combinations of Lorentz-violating coefficients. By
using the current clock comparison results, we estimate the limits of SME
coefficients at level of parts in $10^{4}$ down to parts in $10^{7}$. Better
sensitivity may be achieved in the clock comparisons by using the state-of-the-
art optical clocks. Additionally considering relativistic factors in null-
redshift I, the frequency comparison result of E2 and E3 transitions of Yb$^{+}$
can set the limit $c^{e}_{00}=(7.4\pm9.3)\times10^{-9}$ in the electron sector.
Our analysis demonstrates that clock-comparison redshift experiments may
contribute to explore the vast parameters space on searching for the Lorentz
