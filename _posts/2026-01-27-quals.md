I recently took my oral qualifying exam in my PhD physics program, and I passed! It was a lot of work, and so I decided I would take some time to explain exactly what I did to prepare, how it went, and what I would have done differently. 

The exam is something that we (as in all of us physics PhD students at Carnegie Mellon University) have to take in our second year, about a week before classes.
