I recently took my oral qualifying exam in my PhD physics program, and I passed!

This post is my attempt to write down **exactly** what I did to prepare, what actually mattered, what didn’t, and what I would do differently if I had to repeat the process. I’m writing this partly for future students and partly for my future self, because it’s easy to forget the minute details of how it went.

## Context: what the exam is (at CMU)

In Carnegie Mellon’s Physics PhD program, we take an oral qualifying exam in our second year (typically about a week before classes begin). The exam is a committee-style oral where you present a short talk about your research for about 30 minutes, and then answer questions from three oral committee members about the presentation. For me, my presentation was on Jan. 8th, 2026 at 12:00 PM and the writeup was due on Dec. 22nd, 2025. 

The writeup is a paper that you submit a couple weeks before the actual presentation is, so that they have a document they can look at beforehand to come up with questions. The content on the writeup and on the presentation should be pretty similar, without anything completely different showing up. I started the writeup about 4 days before it was due, which I believe was more than enough time to finish it to my satisfaction. Earlier that year, I had a very basic draft of it, that I created by simply appending my two papers togther. The only issue was that the maximum page limit was about 7 pages, according to the rubric, but my draft was already at like 36 pages, so I realized I had to actually put in the effort to make it concise. 

The writeup is split into roughly five sections: 
1. Introduction and Motivation: (up to 2 pages)
2. Methods and Approach: (up to 1 page)
3. Status and Results: (up to 2 pages)
4. Conclusions and Next Steps: (up to 1 page)
5. Basic Physics connections: (at least 1 page)

Adding these up yields 7 pages, but the rubric suggested a maximum limit of 6 pages, with the figures/tables and references not counting towards the total count. My idea of how I can apportion the parts into the pages was with this visual.

My goal here was to summarize these two papers that I had wrote over the last 2 years, and do it in such a way that would make sense. My first project focused on the energy density of inflationary gravitational waves, modified by massive gravity, and my second project focused on the overlap reduction function, modified by massive gravity. Both were in the context of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), so in a sense, they were both sides of the same coin. What I ended up doing was splitting the Methods and Results sections in 2 parts, each, where I focused on what I did and got for each of the two papers individually. This was the best way I could think of to coherently explain my work that tackled two different aspects of the same PTA data. 

My actual writeup ended up having the following structure

I was very pleased with how it came out, and I submitted it around 10 hours before it was due. Much of my presentation would be based on the content I mentioned in the paper, but I knew the hard work was still ahead; I still had to fill in the details of the slides.

My slides were structured in the following way

- **Research portion:** with recommended time of 20 minutes
- **Basic physics connection portion:** with recommended time of 10 minutes

This was what the rubric required us to split the talk into, but within each section, you have complete freedom with what you choose to include, as well as where you want the basic physics connections to go (perhaps in the intro when you are deriving your theory,or at the end, to make it simple for time-keeping). I personally put it at the very end
