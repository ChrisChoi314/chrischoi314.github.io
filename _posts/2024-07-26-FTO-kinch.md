I made an [FTO Kinch rankings sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YToga0YcG2EagDfU7jvkVqoJpNOtuuC2dwnEFIvHQNw/edit?usp=sharing) using Tyler Hicks's idea of averaging the kinch of everyone's single, ao5, ao12, and ao100. I also borrowed a lot of the coding from James MacDiarmid's nationality rankings he made a while back, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18h14yVNiSZscU69jcvmXA8EHmYmMYCZ_6Ma0W2FwlNA/edit?usp=sharing).

His ranking pulls from the [main FTO rankings sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JjHTxu-KOpwmHGyGmgBa1N4WTmu3CEKAUyZ1BykRg58/edit?usp=sharing) that Ben Streeter maintains, as well as the online weekly competition for [speedsolving.com](https://www.speedsolving.com/competition/index.php) and as well as the unofficial cubingcontest rankings for when people compete in it at comps. 
Hopefully, this is a better way of defining how "good" someone is at FTO, which takes into account all the different time formats. 

Note that the kinch scores aren't weighted in the overall result; they all have the same weight. Obviously it would make more sense to weight the ao100 the most, ao12 less, and so on. But if we weight it based on the number of solves, then it just goes back to being a ranking of people's ao100, and we already have that. For now, I will keep the weights to be the same for all of the time formats. I do think *some* weighting would certainly be better, perhaps something more fair would be to weight the ao100 4 times, the ao12 3 times, the ao5 twice, and the single once. That way, it does reward a better ao100, but also respects the skill someone had in pulling off a really good single.
