Prog is short for progressive rock or metal, the genre of music that originated in the UK and the US with bands Pink Floyd and Procol Harum, and with progressive albums like Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by the Beatles. The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) has a lovely introduction, but to briefly recount, it is a genre that constantly tries to push its boundaries, exploring novel insturmentation, time signatures, and chord progressions. 7/4 or 5/4 time signatures aren't too uncommon, and particularly wild time signatures 11/8 appear [occasionally](https://youtu.be/zXdHNa0itZo?si=kID6NtCRcltkTLvS&t=378).

My own introduction to them was technically through Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (I know, how original) on Feburary 28, 2017. It was shortler after I had discovered rock as a genre in general, and was riding high on my newly discovered bands like Radiohead, Queen, and the Rolling Stones. Besides that one album, however, I don't believe I revisted prog until May 2, 2018, when I discovered The Ministry of Lost Souls by Dream Theater through this, admittedly snobby, [youtube video](https://youtu.be/wjkdGwHe5qg?si=1DzqvrFIRGPGe5nG). But what it had done was unlock this whole other world of music that I had never heard before. The Ministry of Lost Souls itself was no slouch; it's 14:57 long and has some of the most iconic, haunting guitar riffs that goes on and on, continually modulating upwards until it famously "fades" out in its outro. 

I think this song definitely tinted my taste in songs permanently, since after that, I sought other songs with similarly grandiose melodies and durations. I present to you a list of all the songs in prog that I have since discovered and fell in love with. I have compiled as much as of these as I could into a [spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ROJq2mx5ZURHwV62GPQTP?si=b55e108ddf1946ff)
