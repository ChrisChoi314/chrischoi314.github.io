I am a 2nd-year PhD student studying Physics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), in the field of cosmology. I graduated from CMU with a Bachelors of Science in Physics and a minor in Math in 2024. I am currently advised by Prof. [Tina Kahniashvili](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/people/faculty/kahniashvili.html). 

## Background

 I am originally from South Korea, and grew up mostly in Queens, NYC. My parents are from Jeollabuk-do, but I myself was born in Seoul. We moved to Los Angeles when I was about 3 months old, and then to NYC when I was around 5. Since 2020, I have been living in Pittsburgh for school.

## General Interests

I enjoy reading hard sci-fi. You can check out my [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86513877-chris-choi), where I update my catalogue and occasionally post reviews. I also love listening to prog rock and prog metal. I also enjoy consuming anime in my free time, you can check out my [MAL account](https://myanimelist.net/profile/ChrisChoi314). I am also [competitive speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016CHOI01), with a focus on the Face-Turning Octahedron. I also enjoy drawing in my spare time. My portfolio can be found on my [art instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sophonicai/). I also enjoy climbing, calisthenics, and working out. Another passion of mine is the study of linguistics. I am endlessly fascinated learning about the various language families across the globe and how they are all related.

## Research Interests

My research explores how we can utilize the theory of gravitational waves to explore and constrain theoretical cosmology models, particularly massive gravity. I also utilize pulsar timing array data to gain information about the gravitational wave background, and potentially explain it with new theories of cosmology and gravity. I used a time-dependent model of massive gravity, specifically one known as the minimal theory of massive gravity, to explain the stochastic gravitational wave background detected by NANOGrav in their 15-year dataset. There is a possibility that part of the gravitational wave background is of cosmological origin, because the astrophysical explanation falls short of being able to adequately explain the background. I am also interested in the ways gravitational waves can be altered by free-streaming neutrinos, something I previously investigated. We explored the possibility of establishing a particular damping amplitude and comparing the results with previous work. Currently, I am working on analyzing the additional polarization modes from massive gravity and how it modifies the overlap reduction function.
