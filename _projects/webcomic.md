# **Rebellion In My Mind**

In 2020, I published my first [webcomic](https://tapas.io/series/Rebellion-In-My-Mind/info). It was for an English class at Stuyvesant High School called Writing to Make Change, where we studied a variety of genres, including personal essay, memoir, fiction, drama, op-eds, poetry, graphic novel, and the infographic, to learn how people generate writing for a public audience to make change. For the final project, where we were tasked to craft a piece for publication, I chose to create a webcomic to express my inner struggles with religion. 

## The Double Life

The decision to make a webcomic dealing with my religious beliefs was not spontaneous. It was motivated by years of personal experience caused by a fundamental change in my view of the world. At some point in 2018, I was no longer sure whether I believed in God anymore. This had profound implications on my life. I come from a Christian household; My family has been going to church ever since I can remember, my father is a pastor and missionary, and both my parents have majored in theology in school. As a result, I felt that I had no choice but to maintain a lie in front of my family when I stopped believing. I didn't know how my parents would react if I told them, and so I kept it a secret from my family. I led a secret double life, on the internet, in front of my friends at school, and within my own mind, where I could freely express my thoughts. Since then, I have told my parents what I believe and, although they were reluctant to accept it at first and still encouraged me to go to church, it wasn't the opposition I expected. 

I couldn't pinpoint exactly when I began this double life, but I suspect it wasn't long after May 6, 2018, when someone created a Facebook poll about whether your beliefs regarding religion are the same as earlier in your childhood. I commented something nonchalant,
remarking on a grammatical error in the post because I was afraid to actually address the content of the post. Too afraid to even vote in the poll, in case one of the members in the group would rat me out to my family. At the time, it was a reasonable suspicion, considering there were a few people in that group that had connections with my brother, so I thought they might have been religiously motivated to snitch on me. But of course, in retrospect, that was such an unreasonable thing to be afraid of. Who would do such a thing? My paranoia has certainly declined over time, as I now freely share my thoughts and participate in debates about what I believe to be true. However, I am still only able to do so in private groups that my family isn't a part of. 
	
While on the internet it may be quite easy to avoid detection from my family, it is much more difficult, mentally and emotionally, to do this in real life. If I were like most Christian kids and went to a local church, it would've been simple to skip sermons and lie to my parents. But ever since 8th grade, my parents decided it was best to hold the Sunday church service at home, conducting a "family church" where they forced me to play the piano for the hymns. Meanwhile, both my older and younger brothers were able to go to churches elsewhere. I can't help but suspect that my parents thought my faith wasn't strong enough, so they felt the need to keep a close eye on me during service. Regardless of their intentions, I felt no need to actually listen to my father's sermons, since I regularly disagreed with more than 90% of what he said. I tried my best to pretend to be paying attention while focusing on more productive things or just daydreaming.

The Coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated my animosity towards religion, unfortunately. My father used it as an opportunity to force my family to do daily bible studies, which I had thought was a waste of time. I had to passively resist these as much as possible, waking up late and convincing him I had online classes so that I couldn't do them. This backfired on me, as he had moved the studies to the morning, before all classes, but even so, I was able to successfully convince him to not do them on weekends. I regularly clash with my parents when they try to force their religious beliefs on me, but with exercised restraint, as to never reveal my true beliefs. It is so hard to do.

## My Artist Renaissance

My second inspiration for this piece came from the arts, both the musical and visual forms. I was a classically trained musician, receiving piano and flute lessons until I was in 8th grade. As a result, classical music was all I listened to. I can recall embarrassing moments when I thought all music that was written after 1930 was unlistenable. But when I visited my relatives in Korea the summer before 9th grade, I discovered rock music when I heard Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen for the first time. It wasn't until early 2018 when I discovered a musical genre known as progressive rock/metal, or prog, when I watched an innocent Youtube video.
 	
The guitar solo that Mike Kupris featured in the video was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard. All of the mainstream and indie rock I heard up to that point didn't even compare. I realised how incredible this new genre was, and it has staunchly remained my favourite genre of music. Since then, I discovered hundreds of bands and have seen five prog bands at concerts. In fact, one of the bands I feature in my webcomic, Opeth, toured in NYC before the quarantine, and I went to go see them. It was one of the most enjoyable concerts I attended, with the endless banter and monologuing of the lead singer between the songs. But it isn't an exaggeration to say that my discovery of prog had changed my music taste forever. In fact, one of my new dreams is to write a progressive metal album masterpiece, including a song that has a length of over 20 minutes, and go on a sold-out world tour with my band mates.

As for the visual form it all started when I decided to draw an anime girl's face during English class. Well, actually, it goes back to 8th grade when my brother showed me my first anime, or japanese animation/cartoon, but that's nothing compared to the event that took place on December 16, 2019 (or some day around then) Could I truly draw an anime girl? After all, I had spent 4 years consuming anime and manga, or japanese comics (over 130 of them in fact). Prior to this, I had not taken drawing seriously at all. My "drawings" consisted of random doodles in Spanish class when I was bored (as I often was) or the occasional sketch of a diagram in science class. Well, lo and behold, my first go at an anime face went terribly.
             
			 
It is actually very interesting to revisit this moment. I knew about the disproportionately large anime eyes, but not about their placement or the head shape. And I was still accustomed to the "childish" way of drawing hair, drawing the individual strands. The very next drawing I drew underneath it was a cat (I have no clue why). The next three faces I drew degenerated into worser and worser iterations, approaching nightmare fuel on that last one. Horrified, I spent the next few weeks drawing from references, but they weren't much better. After several weeks of casually doing sketches, I took to the tutorials on Youtube. I wouldn't have sought them out if it weren't for my friends on social media offering tips for improvement, so I am forever in their debt.
	
I gradually improved my art on pencil and paper, but it wasn't until I got my first drawing tablet that I really started to see growth. I was inspired to get a drawing tablet when I installed my first drawing program, Krita, and was frustrated with how unresponsive my laptop's screen was to my fingers. I knew professional artists used touch tablets designed for drawing that had pressure sensitivity, so about a week into the quarantine on 3/21, I ordered a cheap pen tablet: the Huion HS611 ($80 on amazon). It came much sooner than expected and I forced myself to use it every single day for the next month. This was perhaps the most valuable factor in my decision to go with the webcomic for the Writing to Make Change piece. During the month of April, I became used to the pen tablet and exponentially improved my art skills. If it hadn't been for the extra time I had because of the coronavirus quarantine, I doubt I would have been confident  enough to even attempt the webcomic. 

## Execution Commentary
	
On April 8th, I expressed my idea to my WTMC group of attempting a simple comic for my Writing to Make Change piece. However, my original intention was to do a sort of religious deconstruction, similar to what Rhett did on the Earbiscuits Podcast, where I would describe my journey to becoming an atheist. But a few problems arose; my journey was difficult to recollect. I never wrote anything down, in fear of my family finding out. I couldn't even recall a point when I stopped believing in God or what my reasons for it were, but that type of information is necessary for what I wanted to make. Therefore, I decided to create a narrative of the experiences I went through, told through the eyes of an anime girl. I want to point out that I am not gender questioning, as some people have asked. I chose to depict the protagonist as a girl for two reasons:
1. Anonymity. I didn't plan on sharing my webcomic to my family, but even if they did end up finding it, it wouldn't be obvious it was me since the protagonist is a girl (however, in retrospect, I realise I added stuff that would make it obvious to them that I made it).
2. Ease of Drawing. I have practised drawing girls way more than I did drawing boys when I first started out. I was worried about the potential loss of quality of the piece if I made my protagonist a boy. 

When I finally decided to take on the monumental task of creating a webcomic, at least a short one, I knew I had to rigorously plan it or else I wouldn't finish in time. I sort of had a vague idea that mangakas, people who make manga, planned out their stories beforehand. So I spent 4/21 and 4/22 coming up with a general plotline for my comic. I first started by opening a google document and jotting down what events I've experienced that I wanted my protagonist to go through. From there, I crafted the first draft of a complete story line. I originally planned to make it 20 pages, because that's how many pages a typical manga chapter or doujinshi, or self-published amateur comics, had. But my first draft ended up being only 18 pages long, and it only went down from there. After this, I knew I had to start drawing immediately.

The first thing I did was go back and rewatch a video by a professional mangaka, Akihito Yoshitomi. In this video, he documents how he creates his serialised manga series through a very rigorous self-imposed schedule. He always did sketches for the next day's work in order to have an "ahead" state of mind, something I found very interesting. He had a little paper that kept track of his progress with coloured check marks and circles, so I decided to do it with my comic. Before I started drawing, I decided that I would split my webcomic creation into three distinct phases: a sketch phase, a lineart phase, and a shading phase. Here is a visualization of my workflow, using the 4th page of my webcomic as an example.

## How To Create A Manga Page, in 5 Easy Steps!

1. First, I laid down the borders of the panels. This
 required careful planning because I needed to 
know how many panels to use and what sizes to make them. On this page, I decided to be dynamic and leave out the panel on the bottom to allow the character to fill the background. 

2. Then I drew the sketches with dull blue-green ink, to make it contrast with the black lineart. Using a different color ink for the sketch was inspired by cartoonist and anime artist SrGrafo. I also
copy and pasted sketches if the faces I used
were the same but with different 
expressions. I made sure not to do this too often
because I didn't want to come off as lazy, but 
it was very convenient during certain scenes. 
For this particular page, I think I accidentally drew
the middle girl in the top panel on the wrong layer
so I went over her in gold ink to attach her to
the correct layer. 

3. Next, I drew the lineart, which included the final
black outlines of the characters and the speech 
bubbles. Having the sketch in the background 
made it easy to draw decent looking
lineart, but I didn't do the sketch part for a lot of 
the later pages (I went right into the lineart
because of laziness). For the speech bubbles,
I was debating on how to do it, as I knew a lot of 
webcomic creators used speech bubble templates
that they just copy and pasted, but I found that too 
confusing to do so I just drew the bubbles by hand. 

4. Next, I came up with the text that would go on the page. Sometimes I did this before starting the page, but usually I came up with what they say as I typed them in. The method I used to input the text was very 
inefficient and buggy, but now that I have gone through this process, I know how to do it better. 

5. Lastly, I shaded the page. This took place after I  completed the previous 4 steps for all of the pages (with the exception of the last page where I did the shading immediately after). I found it convenient to
do it all at once because I had to make sure I was 
using same shade of grey for specific recurring 
things, like the main character's shirt and her hair. 
For stuff like the eye and the mouth, I didn't really 
spend too much time making sure it was the exact 
right shade of grey, I just estimated it with my eyes, 
choosing a grey that was "just dark enough" or 
whatnot. 

Tada, a completed page! 

## Inspirations and References

The protagonist was based off of Ema Yasuhara from the anime Shirobako. The first scene of the story, which detailed how the girl was late for school, never happened to me, but I was forced to recite the prayer everyday before I left for school. I did try to ignore my father, but I never dared to neglect reciting it. 

The conversation between the girl and her friend never happened to me, but I did get similar reactions when the people I used to go to church with found out my dad was a pastor. The purpose of the girl talking about Opeth was to establish a connection between her and prog, allowing me to seamlessly insert the flashback scene and the song Ghost of Perdition. In retrospect, her dialogue about her dad's band not getting the signature seems a little cringy and out of place, but it was the best I could come up with. I admit, I'm not exactly the best storyteller. 

The next scene with the girl walking home from school and listening to George Carlin did not happen to me, but I did listen to George Carlin for the first time several months ago and I found him to be very entertaining. The comedy bit I show in my webcomic was exactly what he says in one of his most famous specials. I had to change the title that appeared on the phone the girl was holding (the original title is "George Carlin --- Religion is Bullshit") because I felt it would be too offensive and vulgar. Also, the girl is walking home and not being driven home because her parents leave for work after she goes to school, much like my family.   

When she gets home, she has an interaction with her older sister, similar to the one I had with my older brother. The day I discovered George Carlin, I wanted to tell my brother about it. He had previously introduced me to the comedian Dave Chapelle. But when I asked him if he'd heard of Carlin, ready to recommend a non-religious video of his, he said that he didn't like Carlin and his takes on religion. He said Carlin was very misguided, and then he walked off. Also, ever since he was in middle school, he attended his church's praise team practise every week, so the thing the older sister says in the comic was faithful to real life. And the expression that the sister makes when she finds out it's Carlin was directly inspired by Senjougahara Hitagi in the Bakemonogatari manga. 

I had trouble trying to figure out how the protagonist would browse the internet, but ultimately I decided on 3 posts she sees on "Jacebook", a facebook knockoff for copyright reasons. Each post I include were things I have seen on the internet, the last one being something I came across on reddit in r/coolguides. I wanted to show how even when I was browsing social media I wasn't safe and had to exercise caution. Very Orwellian. Also, the girl's bedroom was inspired by my own room. 

After this scene, I had a couple ideas of what I wanted to do next. In my first draft, I originally planned for her father to come into the room and tell her to come out to do bible study, where she initially refuses but her father raises her voice. Then the next scene would have been the bible study, filled with her thoughts during the activity and the prayers. But I decided to take the scene out because I realised the story would be way too long and felt that the scene would be too uncomfortable and personal to show. I considered replacing it with a dinner scene or a scene where she helps her little sister with homework, but those were also unnecessary. As a result, I was able to cut my story from 18 to 15 pages. 

Instead, I chose to show the theater scene next, which I originally intended as the final scene. This scene in real life unfolded pretty much how I showed it in the story: my father told me that we were going to see a theater show of Jesus's birth near Christmas, but I really didn't want to go and told him I would be busy with college applications. He started to get really mad but my mother deescalated the situation by saying that they could invite church friends. And the part where the protagonist refuses to go was directly inspired by the famous JoJo Part 4 scene when Rohan Kishibe refuses to comply:	

Finally, the last scene is perhaps the most powerful scene of the webcomic. Believe it or not, this entire scene is almost entirely based on reality. I was on the couch in the living room, listening to Oni-chan by Others by No One. I was introduced to them earlier that day when a facebook friend told me about them. It was my 3rd time listening to the song. My mother was sitting on the couch next to mine when she heard growl vocals from my phone. The rest of the story unfolded pretty much how it happened in the webcomic, except I didn't do that dramatic "I'm going home" exit. I just tried to laugh it off but I was seriously spooked. I was actually able to receive the lead singer of Others by No One's blessing to include him in the webcomic. Also, the panel where the mother was comparing the singer to the devil was directly inspired by Ai Hayasaka from Kaguya Sama: Love is war.

In order to make sure I finished the webcomic on time, I made sure to finish the lineart of at least one page every day. I managed to keep this up until page 14, the second to last page. I was having too much trouble trying to figure out the best way to end it, so I took a break from 5/7 to 5/10 because of APs and for mental sanity. When I came back on 5/11, I was able to finish the last page, and for the next 3 days I worked on shading the rest of the pages.

I also had to create a cover page for any website I would upload to, so I decided to go with an abstract image of the girl with various objects around her. I originally planned to have her tied up in chains, representing her lack of freedom, but I found out that chains are really hard to draw so I just drew some ribbons wrapped around her. Much easier to draw. I also created a timelapse of myself drawing it 

## Spreading the Webcomic

My webcomic was now complete. It was 5/21, exactly a month after I started, and all of the .kra files have been saved as .png files in a folder. All I needed to do was upload them. But was webtoons.com still the best fit for my webcomic? Well, after looking through a fair amount of webtoons on that website, I noticed all of them were in colour and only had a single panel per width. I didn't think my webcomic belonged in a place like this, so I did some more research and found tapas.io. Here, there were comics of all types, including the ones in my format. I also wanted this website to gain more recognition. I had to change the dimensions of the cover page, but other than that, the uploading process was straightforward.

My original intended audience was the religious parents who think indoctrinating their children into a religion is okay. Instead, my webcomic was able to reach the people who appreciate stories being told in this art medium, and people who have gone through similar struggles with religion. It has touched those who have known me in my life, as well as those who felt like they did while reading my webcomic. This experience has shown me that compassion can come from beyond religion, and that I am not alone in what I go through. 

## Conclusion

Looking back on this project, 2.5 years after I first published it, I think that this was a necessary step in my ideological growth. I really did struggle during the COVID pandemic because of the pressure and constraints religion caused me to endure. I was able to close a chapter in my life, and I have since mellowed out from my initial, sometimes reactionary views of religion. I enjoy looking back at my work, and wonder at the potential I had if I had kept writing stories. Maybe one day, I'll serialize a story, perhaps in hard sci-fi, and continue where I left off in my artistic journey.
