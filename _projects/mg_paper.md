_This post summarizes the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03932) I wrote with Jacob Magallanes, Murman Gurgenidze, and Tina Kahniashvili. The code for the paper is available [here](https://github.com/ChrisChoi314/constrain_mass_nanograv_15) and the TeX is available [here](https://github.com/ChrisChoi314/constraining_NANOGrav_paper)._

## Background 
On June 28th, 2023, the [NANOGrav collaboration](https://nanograv.org/collaboration/overview) published a series of papers ([1](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951L..11A/abstract), [2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951L..50A/abstract), [3](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951L...8A/abstract), [4](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951L...9A/abstract), [5](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951L..10A/abstract), [6](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...952L..37A/abstract)) on the detection of a [stochastic gravitational wave background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave_background) (SGWB) with a [pulsar timing array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_timing_array) (PTA) and its implications and methods.
